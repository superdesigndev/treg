> Scope note: this fragment is the **Google click-id** path (`treg_ad` → `Org.ad_*` → conversion
> upload). Generic traffic-source attribution — `utm_*` and referrer for sponsor links, newsletters,
> directories — is the separate `treg_utm` → `Org.utm_*` path in `web/sitetrack.js`, documented in
> [data-model](data-model.md) and [api](../interface/api.md). The two are independent; a Google ad
> click with utm tags populates both.

# Google Ads conversion tracking

Off unless `google_ads_customer_id` and `ads_conv_refresh_token` are both set (`adsconv.enabled()`) —
keeps the test suite and self-hosted instances from starting machinery that cannot upload. When off,
`/adtrack.js` is an empty no-cache response and attribution cookies are ignored, so nothing is
captured, queued or uploaded; the whole feature is additive. `google_ads_developer_token` is NOT part
of this gate: Data Manager has no developer-token header, so that setting only matters for the
read-side Ads catalog calls (`oauth_providers.GOOGLE_ADS`), a separate credential entirely (below).

## The chain: capture → store → fire → upload

1. **Capture** (`web/adtrack.js`, a first-party script, no Google tag). It reads `gclid`/`gbraid`/
   `wbraid` off the URL — `gbraid`/`wbraid` are what Google substitutes on iOS traffic, and omitting
   them silently drops a large share of mobile conversions — and writes them into a `treg_ad` cookie
   (90 days, the length of Google's click-through attribution window; `SameSite=Lax` so it survives
   the cross-site top-level navigation an ad click is). No third-party request is made from the
   browser at any point. The cookie records the mutually-exclusive field name as well as its value
   (`gclid|…`, `gbraid|…`, or `wbraid|…`); the old `CLICK_ID|landing` shape remains readable as a
   legacy GCLID.
2. **Store** (`application.signup._ad_attribution_from`, read at both signup doors: `register_user` (`POST /users`)
   and `create_org` (`POST /orgs`), since a browser visitor who clicked an ad can land on either).
   The cookie is decoded and persisted onto the new `Org`: `ad_gclid` (the historical column name,
   now holding any supported click id), `ad_click_id_type`, `ad_landing` (the use-case page slug or
   `ref`/`utm_content`), `ad_click_at`. Once set, never overwritten — attribution is "first click that
   led to a signup," not "most recent."
3. **Fire** — three chokepoints call `adsconv.queue(db, org, action, ...)`, which writes an
   `AdConversion` outbox row inside a `SAVEPOINT` (a nested transaction, not a bare flush or a
   `db.rollback()` — this runs inside the CALLER's transaction, and a plain rollback on a duplicate
   would roll back their work too, e.g. undoing a Stripe credit on a redelivered webhook):
   - `application.signup._grant_signup_promo` calls `ACTION_SIGNUP` before `ledger.grant()`.
   - `api._record_first_call` → `ACTION_FIRST_CALL`, on the org's first successful `/call/`.
   - `billing._credit` → `ACTION_PAID`, on the org's first credited top-up, carrying `value_usd_micro`.
   `queue()` no-ops (returns `False`) when tracking is disabled or the org has no `ad_gclid` — most
   orgs — so the conversion side stays ad-attributed-only while the product metric it rides alongside
   (`first_call_at`) is set for every org.
4. **Upload** (`adsconv.worker`, started from `lifespan` when `adsconv.enabled()`, drains every 300s).
   `drain_once` selects due rows — neither uploaded nor terminal, older than a 6-hour delay, and past
   `next_attempt_at` — and POSTs one batch to the Google Ads API `uploadClickConversions` with
   `partialFailure`. The payload uses the stored click-id field; a braid is never mislabeled as a
   GCLID. Results are acknowledged per operation index: a successful sibling is marked uploaded, a
   failed sibling is not. `CLICK_CONVERSION_ALREADY_EXISTS` is also acknowledged because Google has
   already stored it. HTTP failures, batch/unparseable responses and explicitly transient row errors
   retry indefinitely with exponential backoff capped at 24 hours. Other indexed per-row errors retry
   through eight attempts, then retain the row as a visible dead letter (`failed_at` + `error`). The
   six-hour delay exists because a click id may not be accepted immediately after the click; uploading
   too early can be rejected.

## Authentication: a platform credential, not a customer's OAuth connection

Two different purposes were once conflated here and no longer are. A **customer** connecting their
Google Ads account (`oauth_providers.GOOGLE_ADS`) so their agent can read campaign data is one thing;
**treg** uploading its own marketing conversions to its own ad account is another. The uploader does
not borrow the customer-facing provider or any per-org `Secret` — it holds its own PLATFORM
credential, `settings.ads_conv_refresh_token`, obtained once out of band by an operator via the OAuth
playground with scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datamanager`. `_auth_headers` exchanges it
directly against `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` (`grant_type=refresh_token`), redeemed with
the SAME client the refresh token was issued against — `google_ads_client_id`/`_secret`, reused from
the read-side Ads OAuth client rather than a new one — never the shared `google_client_id` and never
a customer's connection. `google_ads_customer_id` is the target Ads account. Data Manager takes
neither a developer-token header nor a login-customer-id header at all: `google_ads_developer_token`
plays no part in this path, and the manager (MCC) account moves into the request BODY as
`destinations[].loginAccount` (`google_ads_login_customer_id`, hyphens stripped) instead — set only
for manager-account auth; direct client auth leaves it unset. (`Secret.resource_ref`, where it
exists on an unrelated per-org connection, is never the source for this — it names a discovered
target client, not a manager.)

The exchanged access token is cached in `adsconv` **module state** (`_cached_access_token`,
`_token_expires_at`) and reused until within 60 seconds of its ~3599s expiry. `worker` drains every
300s, so most drains hit the cache; re-exchanging the refresh token every pass would be wasteful and
risks Google's refresh rate limit. `test_access_token_is_cached_and_not_re_exchanged_within_its_lifetime`
proves a second same-window drain makes zero additional token calls. A failed exchange raises
`RuntimeError`; `drain_once` runs inside `worker`'s try/except, so that just retries next pass rather
than crashing the loop.

Before this rework, `oauth_providers.GOOGLE_ADS` carried `datamanager` alongside `adwords` so the
uploader could borrow a customer's OAuth connection — but `listing()` shows every provider to every
customer, so that put a marketing-only permission on every consent screen for no reason (`adwords`
alone was confirmed, via a `validateOnly` `userLists:mutate` call, to already cover audience/
customer-match writes). The provider is back to exactly `adwords`; `datamanager`'s `SCOPE_LABELS`
copy stays (harmless, and correct if the scope is ever genuinely requested).

## Idempotency: the outbox's unique constraint, not a check-then-insert

`AdConversion` has one row per `(org_id, action)` (`uq_adconversion_org_action`) — this, not an
application-level check, is what makes every fire site safe under a retried signup or a redelivered
Stripe webhook: `queue()` tries the insert and treats the resulting `IntegrityError` as "already
recorded," rather than racing a SELECT against a concurrent insert.

## Durable outbox, deliberately NOT audit.py or analytics.py

`audit.py` and `analytics.py` are both deliberately **droppable** — `audit.py` sheds rows past its
queue bound, `analytics.py` is lossy by design — because losing a `CallRecord` or a PostHog event
costs nothing but a metric. A lost `AdConversion` is different: it is a conversion Google never learns
about, which trains the campaign's bidding on undercounted data, silently, in the direction that makes
the campaign look worse than it is. So the write is durable (a row, in the firing code's transaction)
and only the upload is best-effort/retried. Nothing in `adsconv.py` routes through `audit.py`.

## `first_call_at` is NOT derived from `CallRecord`

`Org.first_call_at` is set by a conditional `UPDATE` in `api._record_first_call`, not read off the
audit table. `audit.py` sheds rows under exactly the load that makes "first call" data most valuable —
a busy launch — so deriving the flag from `CallRecord` would undercount precisely when traffic is
highest. `_record_first_call` runs on its **own session**, opened fresh via `session_maker()`, and
never raises into the caller's response. This is deliberate: an earlier version committed on the
request's own `db` session mid-settlement (the proxy call was still being billed) and broke 8 billing
tests, because that reaches into the money transaction from outside `domain/money` — the same rule
`money.md` states for ledger writes applies here by extension, even though `adsconv.py` itself never
touches balance.

## Atomicity: two of three fire sites are atomic with their event, one is not

- **`signup`** — atomic. `adsconv.queue()` and `ledger.grant()` both stage in `_grant_signup_promo`,
  and its one commit lands both rows together.
- **`first_call`** — atomic. `_record_first_call` queues the conversion and commits once, on its own
  session.
- **`paid`** — **not atomic**. `billing._credit` commits the credit first, then queues the `paid`
  conversion and commits that separately. A crash between the two commits loses the conversion
  permanently: a Stripe webhook redelivery finds the payment already credited (`fresh` is `False`),
  and the fire site that would have queued the conversion never runs again.

  This gap was found in review and the decision (2026-08-17) was to **accept it and document it
  honestly** rather than restructure `domain/money` to make the credit and the conversion one
  transaction. The cheap fix, if the gap ever matters in practice: a reconciliation sweep over orgs
  that have a credited payment (a `CreditBlock`) and a `gclid` but no `paid` `AdConversion` row, in
  the shape of `reconcile.py`'s other read-only reports. Not built.

## Fixed FX: 1 AUD = 0.70 USD, set 2026-08-17

`usd_micro_to_aud_micro` converts at a **constant** rate (`AUD_PER_USD_NUM=10, AUD_PER_USD_DEN=7`),
deliberately not a live rate, so a change in reported ROAS means the business moved, not that the
currency market did. Integer arithmetic throughout (`usd_micro * 10 // 7`) — the one permitted float
is at the JSON boundary in `build_payload`, because the Ads API's `conversionValue` field is a wire
double; the value that reaches it is computed from the already-integral micro amount, never the other
way around. The outbox stores the original USD amount, never AUD, so a future FX correction doesn't
need to rewrite history — conversion happens once, at upload time.

## The three conversion actions

Created live on Google Ads account `5149790776` (type `UPLOAD_CLICKS`):

| Action | id | Marked |
|---|---|---|
| `signup` | `7723667014` | SECONDARY |
| `first_call` | `7723667017` | PRIMARY |
| `paid` (first top-up) | `7723667020` | PRIMARY |

`signup` is deliberately **secondary**, not primary: `marketing/landing/_measurement.md` argues a
signup measures curiosity, not commercial intent, so it should inform Google's targeting without
being a bidding goal. `first_call` and `paid` are the two events the campaign should actually bid
toward — an agent successfully calling a tool, and a team paying for more balance.

## API version

The uploader pins Google Ads API **v25** (`adsconv.API_VERSION`). v21 was sunset 2026-08-05; the pin
moved to v25 on 2026-08-17 across every place a version is hard-coded (`oauth_providers.GOOGLE_ADS`,
`.agents/skills/google-ads/SKILL.md`, this repo's catalog yaml) — see `architecture/auth-secrets.md`
for the full four-places-at-once list and the two-failure-modes note (a dead version returns a typed
`UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, not the HTML 404 a never-existent version returns).

## Testing hazard: the shared test database

The suite's default SQLite files live under `$TMPDIR/treg-tests/` (per-xdist-worker, out of the repo
tree so file watchers stay quiet), and `reset_db()` (test-only) drops and recreates
every table. Two pytest runs against the same file concurrently corrupt each other — one run's
`reset_db()` mid-flight drops a table the other run is about to query — and the failure surfaces as a
misleading `no such table` error that looks like a flake, not a concurrency bug. This cost this
feature's development several hours and one conversation-round wrongly dismissing a real bug as a
flake before the cause was found. Isolate a run with:

```bash
TREG_TEST_DB_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./some-other.db" uv run --frozen python -m pytest -q
```

## Not built

- **No router / auto-failover** — not applicable here (there is one destination, Google Ads), but
  stated for consistency with the rest of the catalog: treg does not model automatic choosing.
- **The reconciliation sweep for the `paid` atomicity gap** (above) — named as the cheap fix, not
  implemented.
- **The live-click verification** — needs a real ad click, cannot be automated, and runs after this
  documentation lands, before any real spend.
