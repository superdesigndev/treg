# Auth & secrets

Tier 4 has explicit platform-key slots for MiniMax, OpenRouter and Replicate. The web and async cron
receive them as environment secrets, and the worker constructs the same platform bindings as the call
path. Key values are never copied into task records, logs or archive evidence.

## Instagram grant methods (2026-09-01)

Instagram is one provider with two explicit protocol profiles. The default `instagram-login`
profile uses separate Instagram app credentials, comma-separated `instagram_business_*` scopes,
`api.instagram.com` for the code exchange, and `graph.instagram.com` for calls. It exchanges the
short token for a renewable long-lived token and stores the generic refresh protocol in the
encrypted blob. The optional `facebook-page` profile uses the existing Meta app, Facebook Login,
Page discovery, and a derived Page token. The grants are separate `Secret` rows. See
[instagram-oauth](instagram-oauth.md) for the endpoint matrix and setup contract.

The reusable multi-method rules live in `domain/connections/authorization.py`: capability
ownership, legacy-method inference, method-specific profiles, endpoint-method selection, and scope
translation. `oauth_providers.py` supplies registry data and keeps compatibility methods that
delegate to those domain rules. The initial token exchange is an infrastructure adapter in
`infra/oauth_exchange.py`; `oauth.py` is a compatibility facade only.

`authorization_method` is stored on both `PendingOAuth` and `Secret`. Existing Instagram rows are
backfilled as `facebook-page`. The callback performs token and required identity requests after it
closes the database session. A required identity miss produces `setup_required` and no tool. Its
detail comes from the selected provider profile's `identity_missing_detail`, so the shared callback
contains no Instagram copy. Legacy grant inference also uses
`OAuthProvider.authorization_method_name()` everywhere; shared call and reconnect code does not
repeat provider ids.

The hard part: match every credential shape a real skill uses, keep it encrypted, and keep OAuth tokens
alive, without the proxy ever branching on shape.

## Injectors — the seam (`infra/upstream/injectors.py`)
The proxy calls `inject(headers, params, binding, secret)`, which dispatches on `binding["injector"]`
through the `INJECTORS` registry (populated by the `@register(name)` decorator). Four shapes, two
mechanics:
- **place a string:** `env_injector`, `cli_auth_injector` → `_place()` renders `binding["format"]` (with
  `{secret}`) into a header or query param per `binding["location"]`/`["name"]`.
- **pull a field from a JSON blob:** `secret_file_injector`, `oauth_injector` → `_token_from_json(blob,
  binding["secret_field"])` extracts a token (default field `access_token`) then `_place()`s it.

`_place()` overwrites a same-named caller param for query bindings so the injected credential wins.
Adding a shape is one function; the proxy never changes.

## Encryption + tokens (`crypto.py`)
Secret values are **Fernet-encrypted at rest**: `encrypt()`/`decrypt()` use the key from
`TREG_SECRET_KEY`, falling back to an ephemeral `_EPHEMERAL` key if unset (so secrets don't survive a
restart — a loud signal to set the key). `new_key()` mints one. Caller tokens: `new_token()`
(urlsafe random) + `hash_token()` (SHA-256); the DB stores only the hash. Values are never returned to
clients.

## OAuth freshness (`domain/connections/refresh.py`)
Two modes, detected by `is_refreshable(blob)` (has `refresh_token` + `client_id` + `client_secret`):
- **auto:** `ensure_fresh(secret, db, client)` — if `is_stale()` (past `expires_at`/`expiry` minus
  `_SKEW=60s`), the `OAuthRefreshPort` POSTs `token_uri` (default `_DEFAULT_TOKEN_URI`), then the domain
  command re-encrypts and persists the new blob. The read transaction commits before token-endpoint I/O,
  and the conditional write opens a new short transaction, so provider latency holds no pooled connection.
  A **single-flight** `asyncio.Lock` per secret id (`_locks`) plus a
  `db.refresh()` re-check under the lock prevents a refresh stampede. The `_locks` map is now **bounded**:
  before a stale refresh, if it holds more than 512 entries the idle (unheld) locks are dropped — a fresh
  lock is created on next need — so a long-lived worker can't accumulate one lock per secret forever.
  The HTTP adapter updates both `access_token` and `token` keys so either binding `secret_field` stays fresh.
- **manual:** a bare uploaded token (not refreshable) is injected as-is; the user re-uploads on expiry.

`treg.oauth` re-exports the refresh family for compatibility with connect, health, call, and lazy local-run
consumers. `ensure_fresh` is called by `call_tool()` before injecting, and by the health runner. The injector
stays dumb; one refresh function serves both. Its write-back is **conditional on the prior ciphertext**
(`UPDATE … WHERE value = old`) then reloads the row — so under multiple workers a second refresh can't
clobber a refresh_token the first already rotated (the in-process lock alone doesn't cross processes). The adapter always stamps a fallback `expires_at` (so a
provider that omits `expires_in` doesn't force a refresh on every call), coerces a null `expires_in`,
and raises a clear error when a 200 body carries no `access_token`; `_expires_at` treats a naive ISO
`expiry` as UTC.

Resource discovery and resource selection also call this same `ensure_fresh` implementation before
they close their read session and start provider I/O. They do not implement their own lock, exchange,
or conditional write path.

`refresh()` posts the credential's recorded `client_id_param` dialect (TikTok reads `client_key`, not
`client_id`), snapshotted onto the blob at mint time so a refresh months later still speaks the dialect
the grant was minted with. The same snapshotting covers `token_endpoint_auth_method`: X and Pinterest
demand the secret in HTTP **Basic**, and for a while only `exchange_code` knew — so connect succeeded
and every refresh 401'd two hours later (surfaced to callers as `502 oauth refresh failed`; ≥6 orgs
hit it live). Now the method rides in the blob and `refresh()` honors it; a legacy blob without the
field gets body auth, then ONE retry with Basic on a 4xx, and stamps whichever worked — existing
broken connections self-heal on their next call, no migration.

**Connect flow (mint the first token):** `consent_url(pending)` builds the provider consent URL
(default `access_type=offline` + `prompt=consent` so a refresh token comes back); `exchange_code(pending,
code, client)` trades the auth code for tokens and returns a self-refreshable blob. Both honor
per-provider quirks carried on the `PendingOAuth` (snapshotted from the registry entry, below): a provider's
`auth_params` **replaces** the Google defaults entirely (LinkedIn/X/TikTok/Meta reject `access_type`);
PKCE (`pkce_challenge()` — X requires a verifier); `token_endpoint_auth_method` = `client_secret_basic`
(X puts the secret in HTTP Basic, not the body); the `client_id_param`/`scope_separator` dialect; and
`long_lived_exchange` (`_extend_meta_token()` swaps Meta's ~1-hour code-exchange token for its ~60-day
one, non-fatal on failure). Driven by the `/oauth/*` endpoints ([interface/api.md](../interface/api.md)).

**Expiry as a separate axis (`expiry_of` / `expiry_state` / `connection_view`).** Health answers "does
this credential work"; expiry answers "how long will it keep working" — different questions for a
**non-refreshable** token (a LinkedIn non-partner token reads healthy right up until it silently dies at
~60 days). `secret_is_refreshable(secret)` decrypts server-side (blob never leaves the function) to tell
auto from manual; `expiry_state(expires_at, refreshable)` returns `fresh|expiring|expired|unknown` — a
refreshable credential is **always** `fresh` (treg mints on demand, so the user is never nagged), only an
unrenewable one earns a warning (`EXPIRING_SOON_DAYS=7`). `connection_view()` is the metadata-only shape
(no token material) the dashboard/CLI read, with a single actionable `needs_reconnect` flag.

## Curated OAuth provider registry (`oauth_providers.py`)
Two ways to connect a provider. **Bring-your-own (BYO):** `POST /oauth/start` takes a caller-supplied
`client_id`/`client_secret`/URIs — works for any OAuth2 provider. **Curated:** for the providers where
**treg itself holds the approved app** (Google Search Console/Analytics/Business Profile/Tag Manager/Ads, YouTube,
LinkedIn, X, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Meta Ads — added PRs #20/#21), the user picks a provider and
consents, supplying nothing. The asymmetry is the point of a hosted registry: the gating cost on these
platforms is the *approval* (a Google Ads developer token, Meta App Review), not the OAuth dance — treg
has already cleared it. treg's own client id/secret load from `Settings` (named by
`client_id_setting`/`client_secret_setting`, so they come from `.env` like every other setting).
The Meta pair carries three tiers — read / post / **manage** (comments + DMs on Instagram; engagement,
visitor content, metadata/webhooks, Messenger, Page video, leads_retrieval + its required
pages_manage_ads rider, and catalog_management on Facebook Pages) — sized for the 2026-08 App Review
bundle; Instagram manage includes both `instagram_manage_messages` and its Page-side
`pages_messaging` rider. `default_capability` is the broadest tier by design, so a plain Connect asks
for manage.
Meta initially returns a long-lived **user** token, but Instagram Graph operations—especially the
Messaging API—must act through the Facebook Page linked to the selected professional account. The
Instagram provider therefore declares a resource-token lookup. On account selection,
`select_connection_resource()` privately resolves the linked Page token, stores it as
`page_access_token` inside the same encrypted OAuth blob (retaining `access_token` for discovery),
and the provisioned tool's generic OAuth binding injects that derived field. Provider metadata maps
the linked Page id into the encrypted `page_id` context field and declares a generic resource-setup
request. For Instagram, that request subscribes the Page to the app's
`messages,messaging_postbacks` fields. The setup is scope-gated, so read/post-only connections do
not attempt it. Provider discovery and setup HTTP calls run after the read database session closes;
the result is written in a new short transaction. Resource listings and
connection views never include the Page token; existing Instagram connections must reconnect or
reselect their account once to populate it. The token and object id are separate concerns: Instagram
profile/media operations still target the Instagram account id, while Facebook-login inbox sync is
the Page messaging surface—`/{page_id}/conversations?platform=instagram` for listing and
`/{page_id}/messages` for replies. Calling the conversations edge with the Instagram account id
produces Meta error `(#3)` despite a valid Page token.
Google Search Console's hand-written tool example calls out its distinct direct-tool convention:
substitute `{site_url}` with a value encoded exactly once (`sc-domain%3Aexample.com`), and never encode
again a property identifier returned by the sites list.

Google Tag Manager shares the standard Google client credentials and exposes three cumulative tiers:
`read` grants `tagmanager.readonly`; `write` adds `tagmanager.edit.containers`; `manage` adds
`tagmanager.edit.containerversions` and `tagmanager.publish`. The account list is both the health probe
and resource picker, with the selected `accounts/{id}` path stamped into the tool example. treg
deliberately does **not** request `tagmanager.delete.containers`, `tagmanager.manage.users`, or
`tagmanager.manage.accounts`: agents can audit configuration, prepare workspace changes, create
versions, and publish (including rollback by publishing an earlier version), but cannot delete whole
containers or administer access.

Each entry is a frozen `OAuthProvider` dataclass; `REGISTRY` is the `{service: provider}` map. Key
module symbols:
- `get(service)` — look up one provider. `credentials(provider)` — treg's own id/secret (raises if this
  deployment hasn't set them). `is_configured(provider)` — whether this deployment can offer it (a
  `token`-kind provider needs nothing from treg, so always offerable).
- `listing()` — the catalog payload (`GET /oauth/providers`): every provider, grouped by
  `CATEGORY_ORDER`, each flagged `configured`, with per-capability scopes already in plain English via
  `scope_label()`/`SCOPE_LABELS` (a lookup keyed by the raw scope string;
  `test_every_requested_scope_has_a_plain_english_label` guards it). Authorization methods include
  their display label, connect description, and their own configured state. The dashboard and CLI
  consume this metadata instead of mapping provider or method ids themselves. A multi-method
  provider's top-level `configured` value is true when any declared method is configured.
- `consent_notice` — one line the dashboard shows **before** the consent popup opens, for a provider
  whose consent screen names something the user has not seen on treg. Only the Meta family carries one:
  the shared Meta app is registered as **Crewlet**, a sibling product of the same company (Superdesign
  Dev Inc), and Facebook renders only that bare app name with no parent business, so without the notice
  a treg user is asked to authorize a stranger. It rides `listing()` like any other provider field, so
  the UI never hard-codes which services get one; `test_only_the_meta_family_carries_a_consent_notice`
  derives the set from `auth_uri == _META_AUTH` rather than a service list. Meta Developer Policy 1.6
  wants the relationship disclosed at the point of consent, which is why this is not a docs link.
- **Scopes are per CAPABILITY, not per provider** (`scopes: dict[capability -> list[scope]]`). Capabilities
  are cumulative supersets (write ⊇ read); `default_capability` is the **broadest** (an agent product needs
  write eventually, so one honest consent screen beats connecting twice). `scopes_for()` /
  `satisfied_capabilities()` decide when a later capability needs a re-consent.
- `platform_billed` + `billed_read_usd`/`billed_write_usd`/`billed_write_link_usd` — providers whose
  UPSTREAM bills the app owner per use, whoever's token made the call. X is the one entry: it dropped
  plan tiers for prepaid pay-per-use (per resource read / per post written, checked 2026-08-12), so a
  registry X connect spends treg's credits and the proxy meters those calls against the org's balance
  (`api.py` `_billed_marketplace` → the tier-4 reserve→settle path; [money](money.md)). Gated on the
  deploy opting in via `TREG_OAUTH_BILLED_PROVIDERS` (`config.oauth_billed_set` — empty means free,
  the kill-switch shape `platform_providers` uses). The rates here are the fallback for uncatalogued
  routes; a priced catalog entry wins — and since a `free` block has a falsy `usd`, "priced" has to be
  read as *not free*, or a catalog that says $0 quietly bills the fallback instead. **Every X entry
  therefore carries a real rate**, taken from X's per-resource-type rate card rather than one read
  price and one write price (`x.yaml` curates five; `catalog_ingest.X_RATES` transcribes the card and
  `X_ROUTE_RATES` maps the other 168 routes onto it), and `tests/test_marketplace_call.py` walks the
  provider asserting the published number equals the reserved one. The `billed_*` fields here are the
  fallback for a path no entry claims; **the $0.001 owned-read rate is deliberately not among them**,
  since X grants it only to the app's own owner and a registry connect's member never is. `listing()` carries `metered` +
  `billed_rates` so the dashboard can show the price BEFORE consent — and so the catalog's own price
  display can stop calling a connected account free (`catMetered`, [dashboard](../interface/dashboard.md)). A **BYO connect is never metered** — the callback
  stamps `secret.provider` only in registry mode, and that attribution is the whole detection.
- `auth_kind` = `"oauth"` (treg's app), `"token"` (a user-pasted Bearer token: Slack plus the
  MiniMax, OpenRouter, and Replicate AI-generation providers),
  or `"key"` (an **API-key provider** connected by pasting a key: Apollo, PDL,
  Akta, Hunter, Crunchbase, Lusha, Coresignal, Diffbot, The Companies API, LeadMagic on a new
  **Enrichment** shelf, TikHub + Bright Data + Just One API under
  Social, under **SEO** Semrush + DataForSEO, SE Ranking, Moz, Majestic, Serpstat, Parallel under
  **Other** (raw `x-api-key`, with an authenticated non-mutating monitor-list probe), and under
  **Advertising** the ad-intel keys SpyFu, Apify, Meta Ad Library, SerpApi — alongside the OAuth ad
  platforms Google Ads + Meta Ads and the **unconfigured** Microsoft Ads, Snapchat Ads, Pinterest Ads
  (standard OAuth, live once this deployment sets their client credentials) and TikTok Ads (a
  placeholder: its non-standard app_id/auth_code/Access-Token flow needs oauth.py work before it runs)). A
  `token` and a `key` share ONE connect/verify/auto-provision path, so `uses_pasted_secret` (`token | key`)
  gates it while `is_token_kind` stays narrow for Slack's bot-only copy; a key provider needs nothing from
  treg, so `is_configured` is always true for it. The pasted credential rides in a header
  (`token_header`/`token_format`, default `Authorization: Bearer {secret}`) or a **query param**
  (`token_location="query"` + `token_param` — Semrush spells its key `?key=`); the connect probe hits
  `base_url`+`probe_path`, or an absolute `probe_url` when the cheapest key-check lives on another host
  (Semrush's balance endpoint on `www.semrush.com`). Validity is read from the HTTP status, a truthy JSON
  `token_verify_field` (Slack's `ok`, Apollo's `is_logged_in` — both answer 200 even on a **bad** key), a
  `token_ok_field`==`token_ok_value` match (Majestic's `Code`=="OK"), a `token_reject_field` present
  (Serpstat's `error`), or an `ERROR`-prefixed text body (Semrush). The connect probe may be a POST with a
  `probe_json` body (Serpstat's JSON-RPC), and `token_encode="base64"` turns a pasted `login:password` into
  the Basic blob for `Basic {secret}` (DataForSEO, Moz). `can_autoprovision` (has a `base_url` and either needs no
  second credential or treg holds it) drives auto-building a callable tool on a successful connect;
  `needs_extra_credential` covers a second header the primary slot can't carry: Google Ads'
  `developer-token` (treg-held, via `extra_credential_setting`) and Tomba's per-user `X-Tomba-Secret`
  (setting left empty → the user supplies it through `POST /connections/{id}/extra-credential`, which
  rebuilds the tool with BOTH bindings — the primary half comes from `_provider_bindings`, so it follows
  the provider's own auth shape rather than assuming OAuth). Tomba's probe (`/v1/usage`) deliberately
  answers the key alone, so connect-time verification works before the secret is bound.
  `required_headers` carries fixed provider protocol headers that must accompany the credential on
  every request (Crustdata pins `x-api-version: 2025-11-01`). The connect probe sends them too, and
  `_provider_bindings` turns each into an ordinary constant-format binding over the same secret
  reference. The generic injector therefore overwrites a stale caller value without teaching the
  proxy which provider it is relaying. `_platform_bindings` mirrors the same constants when tier 4
  is enabled, so a platform key cannot silently lose a required protocol header. The metadata alone
  still does not opt a provider into tier 4; pricing, a configured platform-key setting, and the
  deployment allow-list remain separate gates. Secret-evidence scrubbing ignores a binding whose
  format has no `{secret}` placeholder. This keeps a protocol constant such as `2025-11-01` out of
  the secret-spelling set while the real credential and its rendered authorization value remain
  scrubbed.
  **Split-host vendors get one extra Tool per host** (`extra_tools`): GA4 runs reports on
  `analyticsdata` but lists the property ids those reports need on `analyticsadmin` — one scope covers
  both, but `/call/` resolution is per-HOST, so without a second row the agent is walled off (admin
  path on the data host → Google 404; admin host → treg "no registered tool"; 13 calls/7 orgs observed
  stuck there). The extra (`<connection>-admin`) binds the SAME secret, upserts idempotently on
  connect/reconnect, and `_backfill_provider_extra_tools` runs after the schema phase in the ordered
  release upgrade to heal older connections automatically. The schema phase uses Alembic directly for
  empty or stamped databases and refuses a non-empty unstamped database with the 0.14.x adoption remedy.
  The default `python -m treg` serve command runs
  that phase before Uvicorn; raw ASGI deployments run `python -m treg upgrade` once per release. The
  backfill is registry-generic: it scans provider-attributed
  Secrets, requires the corresponding main Tool to be bound to that Secret, then calls the same extra
  upsert, so adding a future `extra_tools` entry needs no one-off migration. Revoke already sweeps the
  companions (any tool whose only binding was the deleted credential goes). `resource_example` closes the loop from the
  other side: the moment the user picks their property (`POST /connections/{id}/resource`), the
  template renders `{resource}`/`{resource_name}` into a ready-made call stamped into the data tool's
  examples (marker `stamped: resource`, so re-picking replaces instead of piling up).
- Post-connect helpers the dashboard/CLI drive: resource **discovery** (`supports_discovery`,
  `discover_*` — which site/property/account this connection acts on), row **enrichment**.
  Discovery can walk a SECOND listing (`discover_extra_path` + `discover_extra_list_paths`): Meta's
  Business Manager owns assets on the user's behalf, so an agency member sees `[]` from
  `/me/accounts` for exactly the Pages/Instagram accounts they manage all day — the Business walk
  (`/me/businesses?fields=owned_pages{…},client_pages{…}`, gated on the `business_management` scope
  now in every Facebook/Instagram capability) flattens nested lists of primary-shaped rows into the
  same picker, deduped by id with the primary listing winning, and a failing extra listing is
  swallowed (pre-scope connections get a clean permission error that must read as "no extra assets"),
  (`supports_enrichment`, `enrich_*` — Google Ads returns bare ids, so a per-row lookup fills the human name),
  and **identity** (`has_identity`, `identity_*` — providers with nothing to pick, like LinkedIn/X/TikTok,
  capture who consented instead). A `probe_path` gives registry tools a real health check.
- **A versioned path expires on a calendar, not on a deploy.** Google Ads puts its API version in the
  URL, so `probe_path`, `discover_path`, `enrich_path` and `examples` all hard-code one. Google sunsets
  each major after ~12 months: v21 died on 2026-08-05 and every Ads call — including the connect-time
  account listing — failed until the pin moved to v25 on 2026-08-17. Nothing in the codebase can catch
  this. No commit changed, no test failed (nothing in the suite makes a live call), and the two failure
  modes read differently: a version that **never existed** returns an HTML 404, a **sunset** one returns
  a JSON 400 `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`. `POST /health/run` would surface it on the day it breaks — it probes
  every credential through the same versioned `probe_path` — but nothing schedules it; `render.yaml`
  carries only Render's own `healthCheckPath: /meta`. Bump the version in all four places together:
  `oauth_providers.GOOGLE_ADS`, `catalog/google-ads.yaml`, `catalog/google-ads.extended.yaml`, and
  `scripts/catalog_ingest.py:GADS_VERSION`.

## Credential health (`health.py`)
`run_all(db, client, org_id=None)` iterates tools (filtered to `org_id` when set, so `/health/run` never
leaks another org's credentials): `oauth.ensure_fresh` each oauth secret (a failed refresh → the secret
is `_mark`ed `invalid`), then runs the tool's optional probe via `_probe()` (an injected request to
`health_check.path`, checked against `expect_status`; a non-dict `health_check` is ignored). **Each tool
is processed inside its own try/except** — one bad tool (malformed `health_check`, weird binding, decrypt
error) marks its secrets `unknown` and the batch continues, so a single tool can never 500 the whole run
(regression: it once did). Bindings are read with `b.get("secret_id")`, skipping any without a live secret. Per-secret status is persisted; the run notifies/reports only the secrets **evaluated this run** (not
every persisted-`invalid` secret, or a since-unbound one would be re-alerted forever). a secret unbound from its last tool is reset to `unknown` (no frozen stale verdict). `_notify()`
best-effort POSTs invalid credentials to the owner's `webhook_url` — searching **all** the owner's
memberships (webhooks are usually set only on the personal org, so a team-org credential would otherwise
never alert), then falling back to a current org-owner's webhook if the owner has left — but only to a
**`safe_webhook_url`** target: `webhook_url` is user-set (even via the
unauthenticated `register_user`), so non-http(s) / loopback / private / link-local hosts are rejected at
set-time and re-checked before POST (blind-SSRF guard). Triggered on demand or by a cron hitting
`POST /health/run` (a super-admin may pass `?all_orgs=1` so one cron token sweeps the whole platform).
Verdicts follow **worst-status-wins** within a run (a no-probe tool can't downgrade a secret a real
probe just marked `invalid`), a transport error / `5xx` / `429` maps to `unknown` (not a false `invalid`
+ webhook spam), an injection failure maps to `invalid`, and only secrets **evaluated this run** are
notified/reported. The run also calls `gc_expired_invites(db, org_id)` + `gc_stale_pending_oauth(db,
org_id)` (abandoned OAuth connects hold an encrypted client_secret + a replayable `state`, so they
expire after `OAUTH_PENDING_TTL_MIN`). Alongside the probe verdicts the run sweeps an **expiring** list
over **every** oauth secret via `needs_reconnect()` (built on `oauth.expiry_state`) — not just the ones a
tool probe touched — because an unbound, unprobed, perfectly-healthy credential can still be days from
silent death (the LinkedIn shape). `_view()` now carries `provider`/`refreshable`/`expiry_state`/`expires_at`
so the caller sees both axes. `_probe()` merges a binding's query onto the URL with `copy_add_param` rather
than passing `params=` (httpx would otherwise **replace** a probe path's own query string, e.g. YouTube's
`?part=snippet&mine=true`, and fail a healthy credential).

## Storage / security posture (MVP)
TLS-only in transit (paste/upload over https, like GitHub/Vercel secrets); Fernet at rest. Per-membership
tokens gate the API (`require_member`, [interface/api.md](../interface/api.md)) and scope every call to an
org ([multi-tenancy](multi-tenancy.md)). "Use-without-hold": a tool binding may reference a secret a
teammate uploaded in the same org; the key stays server-side. Later: local-key end-to-end encryption,
finer permission tiers.

## Secret kinds + the one release exception
`kind` also gained **`param`** — a non-secret value (project/org id) stored and injected like a secret but
never health-checked or marked invalid (config, not a credential). Every kind is still Fernet-encrypted at
rest and never returned by `_secret_view`. The **only** sanctioned path that returns a value is a local-run
**grant** ([local-run](local-run.md)): member+ only, owner-opt-in per tool, audited, and for oauth it
releases only the short-lived leaf (the access token) — `refresh_token`/`client_secret` never leave the
server (an oauth `secret_field` allow-list enforces this). Even then the value is not handed to the
member: on Linux the CLI runs as a dedicated `treg-run` user, so the credential lives under that user
(unreadable by the member's uid), not on the member's own account. A deliberate, narrow exception.

**Ownership boundary (who may use which secret).** A member may only **bind/inject a secret they own**
(`domain/tools/bindings.py` — `validate_bindings` / `validate_cli_secrets`, both calling
`require_secret_ownership`; `routers/resources.py` keeps same-named wrappers that translate the
domain's `ToolConfigError`/`SecretOwnershipError` into 422/403); admins/owners
may wire up shared-key tools. This stops a
member laundering a teammate's key into a tool they control (then exfiltrating it via the proxy's
`base_url` or via `/grant`). Editing a tool **grandfathers** the secrets already on it — only a
newly-added binding/inject is ownership-checked — so re-saving an admin-wired shared-key tool doesn't lock
its owner out. And a `/grant` that would return a secret the caller does **not** own (a
shared-key tool they may run but not read) requires the **runner proof** (`X-Treg-Run-Proof` ==
`TREG_RUN_PROOF`, held only by the root-installed `treg-run` runner) — so a direct member call can't read
someone else's key value. A tool's `base_url` is validated against the internal-address block-list (loopback/private/link-local/
metadata, incl. numeric IP encodings) at registration AND the proxy re-resolves the host at call time
(`infra.upstream.ssrf.host_is_public`, also re-exported by `health`, gated by `proxy_ssrf_check`) — no
SSRF, even via DNS rebinding.
