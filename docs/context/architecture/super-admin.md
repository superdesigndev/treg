# Super-admin (the platform view above orgs)

Everything else is org-scoped; super-admin is the one capability that sees **across all orgs**. It's
deliberately separate from org roles.

## Authorization (`require_superadmin` in `domain.identity.access`) — hybrid
A caller is a super-admin if EITHER:
- the presented `X-Treg-Token` equals the env `admin_token` (`get_settings().admin_token`, from
  `TREG_ADMIN_TOKEN`), compared with `hmac.compare_digest` → principal `"env-admin"`; OR
- the token resolves to a `Membership` whose `User.is_superadmin` is set (and not `suspended`) →
  principal = that user's email.

Otherwise 403. The env key bootstraps; `POST /admin/users/{id}/superadmin` then grants named users the
flag (so a web portal can log in with either). Returns a principal string (for audit).

The dependency lives in `domain.identity.access` and every consumer imports it from there; the
transitional `api.py` re-export retired with the rest of the stage-3 compatibility surface.

The cross-tenant read, mutation, and reconciliation handlers live in three ordered blocks in
`routers.admin`. The mutation block shares the org deletion and member-rule cleanup helpers from
`routers.orgs`.

## Suspension enforcement (in `require_member`)
Two flags gate the **org-scoped** path: `require_member` raises 403 if `user.suspended` ("account
suspended") or `org.suspended` ("org suspended"). Set by the admin endpoints below. Super-admin
endpoints are unaffected (they use `require_superadmin`).

## Endpoints (all under `/admin/*`, gated by `require_superadmin`)
- **Reads:** `admin_stats` (totals, `tools_by_injector`/`tools_by_host`, `credential_health` rollup,
  call volume + success rate, `growth` counts — computed in-process over small result sets),
  `admin_orgs` (every org + member/role/tool/secret/bundle counts), `admin_org_detail`,
  `admin_users` (+ their memberships), `admin_tools`, `admin_calls`, `admin_health` (non-`ok` secrets).
- **Failure evidence:** `admin_errors` (`?days=7&limit=100&provider=&status=&tier=`) — failed calls at
  every credential tier, including plain own tools (`tier: null`), with `CallRecord.error_request` /
  `error_response`, the redacted capture of what the caller sent and what the provider answered (see
  [data-model](data-model.md)). `tier` filters an exact marketplace tier; an empty value selects plain
  own tools. Superadmin and not org-admin
  because the rows hold customers' request content; `GET /calls` deliberately does **not** expose
  these columns, and it defers them so they are not even fetched. This route also performs the
  14-day retention pass (`_purge_expired_error_evidence`, blanking to `'<expired>'` on its own
  committed session) — ageing lives here because there is no scheduler and the request path cannot
  hold a lazy marker, `get_session` never committing one.
- **Reconciliation (Phase 5):** `admin_reconcile_drift|spend|repeats` (`?since_days=30`) — cross-org
  aggregates over platform-tier spend, so super-admin and not org-admin: price drift per endpoint,
  settled spend per provider (the invoice comparison), and the repeat-query rate. Query-time reports
  over existing rows; no scheduler. Logic in `src/treg/reconcile.py`;
  `scripts/provider_balances.py` is the manual companion that reads the providers' own balances.
- **Mutations (Phase 2):** `admin_set_superadmin`, `admin_suspend_user`, `admin_delete_user` (removes
  memberships, then `cascade_delete_org` (in `domain/governance/teams.py`) any org left with zero members, and **promotes a survivor to
  owner** in any org left without one), `admin_suspend_org`, `admin_delete_org` (force, cross-tenant).
  Org deletion shares `cascade_delete_org` (in `domain/governance/teams.py`) with the owner's own `delete_org` (one cascade helper: tools,
  secrets, bundles, pending-oauth, call records, memberships, then the org).
- **Last-superadmin floor:** `require_superadmin` returns the principal (`"env-admin"` or the user's
  email); the three destructive user ops refuse (`409`) when demoting/suspending/deleting would drop the
  count of active (`is_superadmin and not suspended`) users to zero — so a superadmin can't self-lock the
  platform out of `/admin/*`. The env token bypasses the floor (it can always recover).
- **Org credit:** `admin_credit_org` (`POST /admin/orgs/{org_id}/credit`) — the HTTP equivalent of
  `scripts/manual_grant.py`. Credits an org with promotional balance through `money.grant()`, preserving
  the invariant that balance = sum(blocks) - sum(holds). Requires `amount_usd`, `ref` (idempotency key —
  a duplicate ref for the same org returns 409), and `reason`. Always uses `kind="promotional"` so the
  credit burns before purchased (non-refundable marketing expense). The script remains valid for
  airgapped / direct-DB ops, and the route removes the need to open Render Postgres IP allowlists.

## Model + migration
`User` gains `is_superadmin` + `suspended`; `Org` gains `suspended` (booleans). The columns are part
of the Alembic baseline schema; a live DB picks up schema changes through the explicit
`python -m treg upgrade` release phase, never on restart.

## CLI (`interface/cli.md`)
`treg admin login --token` (saves the env key), `admin stats|orgs|org <id>|users|tools|calls|health`,
`admin grant|revoke|suspend-user|rm-user|suspend-org|rm-org`, and
`admin credit <org_id> --amount-usd <n> --ref <ticket> --reason <text>`. `_admin_client` sends the saved
`admin_token` if present, else the active org token (works for an `is_superadmin` user).
