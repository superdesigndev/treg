# Tools Registry — charter

## What changed (2026-08) — the catalog became the front door

The charter below describes a **vault**: your team's own keys and skills, made callable without
handing the credential around. That shipped, and it still works exactly as written. But it answers
"share what we already have", and the product now leads with a different question: **"get what you
don't have."**

treg carries ~2,600 catalogued endpoints across ~40 providers (SEO, backlinks, social, enrichment,
ads, scraping) and serves eligible ones **on its own key**, metered per call from a prepaid balance.
The pitch is *"OpenRouter, but for agent tools instead of models"* and *"ask for the task, not the
tool"* — because the tools an agent needs sit behind subscriptions nobody buys for one run.

What this means for anyone reading this fragment:

| | |
|---|---|
| The two halves | **the catalog** (public, metered) and **your own tools** (yours, never metered) |
| Which wins | your own credential always beats treg's, automatically |
| The words we use | `tool` · `the catalog` · `your own tools`. **Not** "vault", "marketplace", or "registry" for either half — `registry` now means only the server/deployment |
| Not built | automatic routing or failover **between providers** of one capability. `treg catalog search` compares them; **choosing is the caller's**. What treg *may* do (when a deployment turns it on, [capacity](../ops/capacity.md)): if its **own** account for a provider is out, serve the **same endpoint** through a relay — same request, same response shape, the relay's real price, disclosed via `X-Treg-Served-Via`; a team can opt out. **First-party routed endpoints** (`treg.<capability>`, generated from verified adapters) are the explicit opt-in where the caller asks treg to choose among providers; each always names the child that served and returns its raw body ([catalog](../architecture/catalog.md) § Routing) |

Money and metering: [money](../architecture/money.md). The endpoint data and its pricing rules:
[catalog](../architecture/catalog.md).

A remote **registry that turns the team's skills into shareable, callable tools.** Any team member's
**agent** (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini) — or a human via CLI/API — can call a tool **without owning its
credentials or rebuilding it**. (Internally we think of it as a *skill registry*: skills + data actions;
"tool registry" is the working name.)

> **Load-bearing idea — the proxy.** The consumer makes the **real upstream API call** (it already knows
> the API, e.g. PostHog) with its own params; the call is **routed through our proxy domain**, which
> **injects the auth** server-side. The consumer never holds the secret. This is the whole point — and it
> survives upstream API version changes, because we don't model the API, we relay it.

## Why
- **Easy sharing / onboarding** — give a teammate *one endpoint* for everything; add a new system without
  re-wiring each person. Example: a new marketing manager calls the PostHog tool with **no API key**.
- **Consumer is often an agent, not a human.** Start with the team; later anyone on Claude Code/Codex/etc.
- Later: **permission levels + audit log** (who used what).

## What a "tool" is
A **skill + its auth**. Auth shapes to support (from the real `superdesign-agi/.claude/skills/`): plain
**ENV vars**, **`.secret/` OAuth token files** (e.g. GCP, Google Ads), **CLI-auth** services, and full
**OAuth** connect flows — not just API keys. MCP is **optional, later**.

## Shape (MVP)
- **API + CLI + one registry skill.** The single `tools-registry` skill is how consumers *call* tools and
  how creators/admins *create / push / list / update / delete* them (full **CRUD**, via both API and CLI).
- **Onboarding flow:** an agent reads an install doc → installs the CLI → user auths → the agent
  identifies the local skills + env/secrets, **uploads/registers** them → returns an endpoint + a
  share-instruction for the team. (Web dashboard = phase 2; minimal, GitHub/Vercel-secrets-style.)
- **Auth from day one** (to store per-user/org secrets). **Allow everyone** to register for now;
  authorization tiers later.

## Security (MVP vs later)
- **MVP:** rely on **TLS/HTTPS** (like pasting a secret into GitHub/Vercel). The proxy already delivers
  "use a tool without the key locally" (the key lives in the registry; a member can build/register tools
  against a secret someone else uploaded — a placeholder).
- **Later (extreme):** operator registration that **mints a local private key** and signs credentials so
  only the server can decrypt them (banking-style) — interception-proof. Not MVP.

## Deploy & scale
Test server first → **Render** (easier to debug). The proxy is **thin** (IO-bound, low CPU/memory) → cheap
to scale; per-tenant cheap machine vs shared = **undecided**, built thin so either works.

## Boundaries / relationships
- **Standalone for now**, separate from SuperDesign. May **later merge with Loopni** (loops + context +
  tool access in one place); Loopni could itself become a tool/runtime in the registry.
- **Distinct from Intel Factory** (`intel-factory/`, which builds knowledge *lakes* per business). This
  shares *tools*, not knowledge. Likely a **community PR-back** flow for new connectors (Intel-Factory style).

## First proving ground
Auto-convert **every skill in `superdesign-agi/.claude/skills/`** into a tool and test each (PostHog, GSC,
…) — proving the *machine that makes any tool*, matching every auth shape. New tools after that = human-added.
