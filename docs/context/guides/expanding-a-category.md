# Expanding a catalog category (adding providers)

How we grew **SEO**, **Enrichment** and **Advertising** from a handful of entries to ten each — and then
Enrichment again by eight providers in one pass (2026-08-20: companyenrich, oceanio, tomba, predictleads,
findymail, branddev, icypeas, leadsforge). This is the repeatable process — follow it whenever a
category needs more providers. Creator/influencer data (influencers.club, 2026-08-21) was the first
provider added under the vendor-listing skill end to end: registry + 15-endpoint catalog, every price
reconciled against the provider's own credit meter.

Provider definitions and setup metadata live in **`oauth_providers.py`** (the `REGISTRY` of
`OAuthProvider` entries). Reusable authorization and consent rules live in `domain/connections`, and
token endpoint I/O lives in `infra/oauth_exchange.py`. Connecting, verifying, and auto-provisioning a
pasted-key provider is **`connect_with_token`** (`POST /connections/token`) in
`routers.connections`, backed by `application.connect`. These parts are documented in
[auth-secrets](../architecture/auth-secrets.md) + [api](../interface/api.md);
this fragment is the *process*, not the mechanics reference.

## The two kinds of provider
- **API-key** (`auth_kind="key"`) — the user pastes a key; self-serve; **the fast path** (research → implement
  → live-test in one session). This is the workhorse and where almost all growth happens.
- **OAuth** (`auth_kind="oauth"`) — treg holds its own registered app; **heavy** (needs a dev-app registration
  + client credentials). Add as **unconfigured** entries (they list `configured:false` until this deployment
  sets the credentials).
- **token** (Slack) — bring-your-own bot token; shares the pasted-secret path via `uses_pasted_secret`.

## The fast path — adding an API-key provider

1. **Curate.** Pick providers that fill a *gap* vs what the category already has (not near-duplicates). Use
   the selection heuristics below. A research subagent is the right tool: give it the pool + criteria and have
   it recommend + reject with reasons.
2. **Get EXACT specs** per provider — `base_url`, auth (location / name / format), a **cheap or FREE probe
   endpoint** (a valid key returns 200, an invalid key does NOT), and the **bad-key behavior** (status, or the
   JSON field that signals invalid). Accuracy of `base_url` + probe path + bad-key behavior matters most,
   because you validate them **live**. Have the research agent say "unconfirmed" rather than guess a path.
3. **Add the registry entry** — an `OAuthProvider(auth_kind="key", …)` in `oauth_providers.py`; add it to the
   `REGISTRY` tuple; add the category to `CATEGORY_ORDER` if it's new. Key providers have `scopes={}` (no
   consent screen); the catalog card uses `summary`.
4. **Placeholder logo** — `web/logos/<service>.svg` (a lettermark; swap for the official brand SVG later). The
   guard test `test_every_provider_has_a_logo` fails without one. Do NOT reproduce a real brand mark — a neutral
   lettermark is the placeholder.
5. **Tests** — add the id to `test_every_provider_is_registered` (test_oauth_providers_m3) and the offerable
   loop in test_key_providers.
6. **LIVE bogus-key test — the load-bearing step.** Start the server and `POST /connections/token` with a
   *garbage* key against the **real** API:
   - `422` "rejected …" → correct (bad key rejected). Ship it.
   - `200` → the probe does **not** validate the key → fix the verify (see the toolbox), or drop the provider.
   - `404`/`502` in the reason → wrong probe path / host → fix `base_url`/`probe_path`.
   This one step caught Apollo (`is_logged_in`), Akta (trailing slash), Majestic (`Code`), and ScrapeCreators
   (accepts any key). **Never ship a key provider you haven't watched reject a bogus key.** Run in a throwaway
   org and delete it after (test users are `e2e-…@treg.local`).
7. **Run the suite, [sync docs](../../../.agents/skills/tools-registry-context/MAINTAINING.md), commit + push.**

## The verify toolbox — which `OAuthProvider` field for which bad-key behavior

| Provider behavior | Field(s) to set | Real example |
|---|---|---|
| Key in a header | `token_header` + `token_format` (`Bearer {secret}` / `{secret}` / `Token {secret}`) | TikHub, Apollo, SE Ranking |
| Free authenticated balance route doubles as a machine-readable rate card | use it as `probe_path`; record its published unit rate on catalog rows | Litescrape `/api/keys/status` (`remaining_calls`, `cents_per_1000_calls`) |
| Key in the query string | `token_location="query"` + `token_param` | Semrush, Diffbot, SpyFu |
| HTTP Basic from `login:password` | `token_format="Basic {secret}"` + `token_encode="base64"` | DataForSEO, Moz |
| HTTP Basic with a RAW token after `Basic ` | `token_format="Basic {secret}"`, **no** `token_encode` | The Companies API |
| Cheapest check on a DIFFERENT host | `probe_url` (absolute) | Semrush (balance host), Diffbot (account host) |
| Probe needs a POST body | `probe_method="POST"` + `probe_json` | Serpstat, Moz, Coresignal |
| No free route at all — the cheapest PAID call is the probe | `probe_method="POST"` + `probe_json` on the cheapest cached call; say the price in `setup_note` | Exa `/contents` on example.com, $0.001; `/v0/teams/me` 404s on every key (2026-08-27) |
| 200 on a bad key; a truthy field = valid | `token_verify_field` | Slack `ok`, Apollo `is_logged_in` |
| 200 on a bad key; a field == a value = valid | `token_ok_field` + `token_ok_value` | Majestic `Code=="OK"` |
| 200 on a bad key; an error object present = invalid | `token_reject_field` | Serpstat `error` |
| 200 on a bad key; an `ERROR …` text body | handled automatically (text-error guard) | Semrush |
| No free probe; valid key 400s on empty body, invalid 401s | `probe_reject_statuses=(401,403)` | Coresignal |
| The provider's OWN "test my auth" endpoint answers 200 with prose for a bad key | probe a DATA endpoint instead | Tiingo `/api/test` (2026-08-14; `/tiingo/daily/aapl` 403s cleanly) |
| Bad key 302-redirects to an HTML login page (a Laravel app that only speaks JSON when asked) | `probe_reject_statuses=(302, 401, 403)` **plus** `token_verify_field` on a body field the redirect lacks | Findymail `/credits` → `email` (2026-08-20) |
| TWO header credentials, both per-user, and a free probe answers the key alone | `extra_credential_label`/`extra_credential_header` with `extra_credential_setting` EMPTY (user binds the second half via `POST /connections/{id}/extra-credential`); probe the key-only route | Tomba `X-Tomba-Key` + `X-Tomba-Secret`, probe `/v1/usage` (2026-08-20) |
| TWO credentials but the API also takes standard HTTP Basic `a:b` | one pasted `key:token` pair, `token_format="Basic {secret}"` + `token_encode="base64"` — no second slot needed | PredictLeads `api_key:api_token` (2026-08-20) |
| A second host that answers 200 to anything (demo/free tier) | pin the host that rejects | CoinGecko demo host (2026-08-14) |
| Accepts ANY key on every endpoint, even premium ones | DROP — cannot ship | Alpha Vantage (2026-08-14: `apikey=bogus123` returned real quote data) |
| Ongoing tool health check | `probe_path` (a cheap GET on `base_url`) | most |

The connect verify already parses JSON only when the response *is* JSON (so a CSV/text body doesn't error), and
rejects on HTTP status by default.

## Common traps (RCAs from real providers)
- **200 for a bad key.** The status lies; read a body field (`token_verify_field` / `token_ok_field`). Apollo,
  Majestic.
- **Trailing-slash 307 redirect.** We don't follow redirects with the key attached, so we only see the 307. Put
  the trailing slash **in `probe_path`** so it hits the clean 401. Akta.
- **CSV / text response.** Don't JSON-parse; the verify guards on content-type. Semrush.
- **Key in the URL PATH** (`/v3/{key}/…`). Our injectors only do header/query — **not supported**. Skip the
  provider (or add a path injector). Adbeat.
- **No free probe.** POST an empty body; a valid key 400s, an invalid 401s → `probe_reject_statuses=(401,403)`.
  Coresignal.
- **API accepts ANY key** (returns success for garbage). You cannot validate at connect — **drop it**; don't
  ship a provider whose key can't be checked. ScrapeCreators.
- **Cheapest check is off-host** → `probe_url`. Semrush, Diffbot.
- **A gateway 504 that still bills.** influencers.club (2026-08-21) fronts slow enrichment with an nginx
  60s cutoff: the first call for a handle took 54–61s, several came back as a 504 HTML page, and the
  backend finished anyway — two of those 504s were charged, one was not. Record it in the catalog
  file's header (retry once, warm answers in 2–5s) rather than stamping the route `unverified`; and
  give `catalog_verify.py` a second pass for the routes that timed out instead of widening its timeout.
- **Django trailing slash.** influencers.club's slash-less paths 301 with the body dropped; the Akta
  fix (slash IN `probe_path`) applies to every catalog `path` too.
- **A cross-platform provider needs its own platform slug.** influencers.club enriches a handle on any
  of 11 networks through a `platform` body field, so no single social slug is honest; it got a
  `creators` platform on the Enrichment shelf (2026-08-21). Platforms cannot be proposed from a
  provider file — add the slug to `capabilities.yaml` and propose only the capabilities.

## Selection heuristics (what makes a provider worth adding)
- **Self-serve API-key first** — sign up, get a key, no sales call. That is the entire speed advantage; anything
  sales-gated breaks the fast path.
- **Distinct value** — fill a gap the category lacks (phones, bulk data, knowledge-graph, tech-stack, GDPR
  email…). Skip near-duplicates.
- **Reliability / legal.** Reject, decisively and *with a recorded reason*: legal/shutdown risk (Proxycurl —
  shut down by LinkedIn's suit, Jul 2025), deprecated/absorbed (Clearbit → HubSpot-gated), UI-only with no API
  (BigSpy/AdSpy), enterprise-sales-gated (SimilarWeb, SensorTower, MediaRadar).
- **The self-serve field is often THIN** (Ads especially — only ~4 real self-serve ad-intel APIs). When N clean
  picks don't exist, **say so** and fill the count with an adjacent-but-clean pick (SerpApi for ads) or an
  unconfigured OAuth platform — don't force a bad-fit provider.

## The heavy path — adding an OAuth provider

One logical provider can have more than one explicit grant. Use `authorization_methods` with
capability ownership and protocol overrides; do not duplicate the provider catalog. Store the
selected method on the pending flow and secret. Add endpoint authorization metadata so catalog
resolution selects by provider and grant identity before it compares shared upstream hosts.
Instagram direct Login plus optional Facebook Page tools is the reference implementation; see
[instagram-oauth](../architecture/instagram-oauth.md).
1. treg must register its **own** dev app on the network → `client_id`/`client_secret` → add the two settings
   to `config.py` (`Settings`) so they load from env; the registry entry names them via
   `client_id_setting`/`client_secret_setting`.
2. Add the `OAuthProvider` with `auth_uri`/`token_uri`/`scopes`/`base_url`/`token_endpoint_auth_method`, a
   **`SCOPE_LABELS` entry for every scope** (guarded by `test_every_requested_scope_has_a_label`), and a logo.
   `write` must be a superset of `read` (`test_default_capability_is_the_broadest`) — or use a single capability.
3. Unset credentials → it lists `configured:false`, so it is **safe to add UNCONFIGURED** to reach a target
   count; it activates when the credentials are set.
4. **Quirks** (all snapshotted onto `PendingOAuth`): `extra_credential_*` for a second header (Google Ads /
   Microsoft Ads `DeveloperToken`), `auth_params={}` for non-Google providers that reject `access_type`,
   `client_id_param` (TikTok's `app_id`/`client_key`), `scope_separator`, `pkce`, `long_lived_exchange`,
   `token_endpoint_auth_method="client_secret_basic"` (X, Pinterest — ALSO persisted into the token blob
   so refresh speaks the same dialect), `extra_tools` for a vendor that splits one product across hosts
   (GA4's admin/data split — each extra host provisions a companion Tool on the same secret; the
   generic `_backfill_provider_extra_tools` release-upgrade pass gives existing connections newly-added
   companions automatically), and
   `resource_example` to stamp a ready-made call onto the tool once the user picks their resource.
5. **NON-STANDARD OAuth is not free.** TikTok Ads (`app_id`/`auth_code`, JSON-body token exchange, `code==0`
   envelope, `Access-Token` header instead of `Authorization: Bearer`) does NOT work with the standard
   shared connection flow or the Bearer auto-provision binding. Add it as a **flagged placeholder** — it
   needs a protocol adapter and binding work before it can run.

## The tests that gate every new provider
- `test_every_provider_is_registered` — add the id.
- `test_every_provider_has_a_logo` — add `web/logos/<id>.svg`.
- `test_default_capability_is_the_broadest` — OAuth: `write ⊇ read` (or one capability).
- `test_every_requested_scope_has_a_label` — a `SCOPE_LABELS` entry per OAuth scope (key providers have none).
- `test_key_providers` — the offerable + connect-flow coverage for `auth_kind="key"`.
