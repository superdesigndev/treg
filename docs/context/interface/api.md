# The API

## Instagram authorization strategy

`POST /oauth/start` keeps the same request shape. `provider=instagram` defaults to direct
Instagram Login. `capability=page-tools` selects the separate Facebook Page profile. The start
response returns `state`, `consent_url`, `redirect_uri`, and `connect_guidance`. The guidance is the
selected authorization method's registry description, so clients do not need provider-specific
setup text. Connection rows now include `authorization_method`, its label, method-specific resource
discovery metadata, and setup health.
Catalog calls accept `X-Treg-Authorization-Method` to select one of an endpoint's declared methods;
the header is an internal routing control and is stripped before the faithful upstream relay.

Catalog calls can fail before relay with HTTP 428. Its `detail` object has a stable error code,
provider, endpoint id, required method, capability and scopes, explanation, CLI command, and
dashboard action. This distinguishes a missing grant, missing resource, missing scope, and expired
grant. See [instagram-oauth](../architecture/instagram-oauth.md).

`api.router` preserves public registration order while concern routers contribute ordered route blocks.
`bootstrap.create_app()` assembles the combined route table into FastAPI roles.
`api.app` remains the deployed, backward-compatible `all` role. Everything the CLI + skill do is one
HTTP call over this. The factory lifespan runs read-only `verify_db()` and creates the shared keepalive
`httpx.AsyncClient` at `app.state.http` (and `audit.drain()`s on shutdown). It also starts the Google Ads conversion uploader (`adsconv.worker`) as
a background task, but only when `adsconv.enabled()` — see
[ads-conversions](../architecture/ads-conversions.md).
Content-driven provider companion backfills run in the explicit `python -m treg upgrade` release
phase, outside every app role's lifespan. The default `python -m treg` entrypoint also provisions the
guarded local single-user identity before Uvicorn starts.

## WAF escape hatch — `X-Treg-Body-Encoding`
Some hosting edges (Cloudflare, including Render's) 403 any request whose **body** matches an
injection signature — a skill recipe or a proxied `call` that legitimately carries SQL/HTML. The
pure-ASGI `_BodyDecodeMiddleware` (registered via `app.add_middleware`) lets a client smuggle such a
body past the edge: send it base64/gzip-encoded and set `X-Treg-Body-Encoding: base64` (or
`gzip`, or `base64+gzip`). The middleware calls `_decode_request_body()` to restore the real bytes,
fixes `content-length`, and hands the decoded body to routing — so both the Pydantic JSON endpoints
(e.g. `POST /skills`) and the `/call` proxy (which relays `request.body()` upstream) see plaintext. A
malformed encoded body is a clean 400. No header ⇒ untouched. The CLI's `_RegistryClient` uses this
automatically on a WAF 403 (see [cli](cli.md)), as does the local proxy for an intercepted call. Body
replay does not imply connection closure: after delivering the decoded request,
`_BodyDecodeMiddleware` delegates later `receive()` calls to the original ASGI channel and forwards
only a real `http.disconnect`. If the client disconnects before the encoded body is complete, the
middleware skips decoding and replays each consumed partial-body message followed by that real
disconnect.

## `503 provider_capacity_unavailable` — treg's own account is out

A metered (tier-4) call whose provider treg's own account cannot serve right now (a confirmed
balance/quota signal, or the capacity sweep) is refused **before any hold** with a typed 503:
`{"detail": {"error": "provider_capacity_unavailable", "provider", "endpoint_id", "resets_at" | null,
"alternatives": [...], "message"}}`, `X-Treg-Error: 1`, no `X-Treg-Cost-Micro`, `refused_by="capacity"`
on the audit row. The caller's own key for the provider is never affected (tiers 1/2 win first), and
treg does not call an alternative on the caller's behalf — it names them. A lock set by the call
path lets one call a minute through as a probe and lifts on its 2xx, so the `message` says a retry
in a minute may succeed; a lock from the sweep lasts until `resets_at`. Not the pool-saturation 503
(`treg_saturated`), which is a different exit. See `architecture/proxy-model.md` § Platform capacity.

## `X-Treg-Served-Via` — this answer came through an overflow relay

`GET/PATCH /orgs/{id}/settings` carries `platform_overflow` (default `true`); `false` opts the team out —
such calls get the `503 provider_capacity_unavailable` below instead of a relay.

`overflow:<aggregator>` on a metered call that treg served through a treg-owned aggregator account
because its own account for the provider was out. Same request, same vendor body shape (routes are
verified for that), the caller paid the aggregator's real price (`X-Treg-Cost-Micro`), and
`X-Treg-Call-Id` is the parent call's. Absent on every direct call. Off by default
(`TREG_OVERFLOW_MODE`). See `architecture/proxy-model.md` § Overflow.

## `X-Treg-Smoothed` — the call waited for treg's own rate limit

On a metered (tier-4) call only: `wait=<ms>` when the call was spaced behind other callers on the
same platform key, `retry=1` when a burst-429 with a short `retry-after` was re-sent once on the same
hold (body-less GET/HEAD only). Informational; the status and body are the provider's. See
`architecture/proxy-model.md` § Burst smoothing.

## `X-Treg-Error` — whose refusal is this?
`bootstrap_handlers._mark_treg_own_errors` tags treg's **own**
refusals on `/call/` and `/catalog/call/` paths with `X-Treg-Error: 1`, then answers exactly as
before — the status and body
are untouched, and a client that ignores the header sees what it always saw. Without it a caller cannot
tell treg's 404 ("no tool registered for that host") from the vendor's own 404: both are a status and
some JSON. The [local proxy](../architecture/local-proxy.md) needs that distinction to explain a failure
without ever rewriting a real vendor response. `application.call` failures carry a mechanism `kind`
and separately mapped `blame`; the compatibility header remains the literal `1`.

Resolution refusals are actionable: a named miss that resembles one of the caller's usable own tools
returns a structured `detail` with `hint` and `did_you_mean`, including after a real catalog endpoint
falls through and finds no usable marketplace credential. A genuine URL-passthrough tie returns 409
with the names of the colliding usable tools and the explicit `/call/<name>/<path>` escape hatch.

## Auth
`require_member()` reads the `X-Treg-Token` header, hashes it
(`crypto.hash_token`), looks up the
`Membership` by `token_hash`, and returns a `Caller` (`membership, user, org` + `org_id`/`email`/`role`);
401 on missing/invalid. Every scoped endpoint depends on it **except** `POST /users` + `POST
/invites/accept` (open, self-registering) and `GET /oauth/callback` (browser-hit, protected by `state`).
Each successful identity dependency commits its read-only transaction before the handler runs, so an
application use case can open its own session without waiting behind the request's pool slot. The
dependency-cached session remains usable because every session maker sets `expire_on_commit=False`.
`require_superadmin` is the one gate on a different pool — it takes `get_admin_session`, and so must
every `/admin/*` handler under it (FastAPI caches dependencies by identity; see
[super-admin](../architecture/super-admin.md)).
Authz = org scoping + a role gate: `_can_manage` lets admin/owner manage any org resource, a member only
what they created; `_require_admin_of` gates the org-admin endpoints. See
[multi-tenancy](../architecture/multi-tenancy.md).

Cookie mechanics stay at the HTTP boundary because they interpret request cookies; the shared
`_same_origin` CSRF check is available to every cookie-authenticated mutation.

Email OTP and invite sign-in use cases own their sessions and every commit, including OTP rate, attempt,
consumption, user provisioning, and invite-token consumption. They return framework-neutral results or
semantic errors; the HTTP boundary maps them to responses and sets browser cookies. Every identity door
reuses the same first-proof provisioning command.

The CLI pairing state machine prunes before creating a pending entry, pops a completed result exactly
once, and preserves session lookup, attempt decrement, pending pop, and result publication order. Its
team-selection sessions are read-only. The three short-lived dictionaries are process-local and shared
by every pairing door.

Social login builds each authorization request, exchanges the provider code, validates the proven
email, provisions the user, and commits before publishing a CLI result. Provider callback state is
validated before resolving the shared HTTP client. `/auth/logout` remains an HTTP-only cookie action.

## Endpoints
- **Users / orgs:** `register_user` (`POST /users`, open, legacy — used by the test fixture) creates the
  user + an org + owner membership and returns a token **once**; the dashboard/CLI login doors do NOT go
  through it (they create the user only, no auto org). Both this door and `create_org` read the
  first-party `treg_ad` cookie (`_ad_attribution_from`) and, when conversion tracking is enabled,
  stamp `Org.ad_gclid`/`ad_click_id_type`/`ad_landing`/`ad_click_at` on the new org when present — see
  [ads-conversions](../architecture/ads-conversions.md).
  `create_org` (`POST /orgs`, `require_identity` so a
  zero-org user can make their first team) + `list_orgs` (`GET /orgs`,
  each org carries a `tool_count` — one grouped query — so the dashboard can land on the org with tools;
  its `active` flag follows `require_member`'s precedence — per-org membership token, else `X-Treg-Org`,
  else a team-pinned identity token's own `org` claim — so `treg login --token <pinned key>` lands on the
  baked-in team instead of the caller's first membership);
  invites via `create_invite` (`POST /orgs/{id}/invites`, admin+) → one-time code (**emailed** via
  `email.send_invite`, best-effort, along with a separate inbox-only `email_token` sign-in link — the
  token is never in the JSON response; see the invite sign-in link below), `accept_invite`
  (`POST /invites/accept`, open) → registers/joins + mints a token. **Code-free invites:** an invite is
  addressed to an email, so `my_invites` (`GET /invites/mine`, `require_identity`) lists every pending
  invite for the caller's proven email and `accept_my_invite` (`POST /invites/{id}/accept`,
  `require_identity`) accepts one with no code (403 if the invite's email ≠ yours). `list_members` /
  `remove_member`
  (`GET`/`DELETE /orgs/{id}/members[/{user}]`, admin+); `set_member_role` (`PATCH …/members/{user}`,
  owner-only), `leave_org` (`POST /orgs/{id}/leave`), `delete_org` (`DELETE /orgs/{id}?confirm=<slug>`, owner-only
  AND the slug is REQUIRED — see hardening — via
  `cascade_delete_org` (in `domain/governance/teams.py`), which now also sweeps each org's `RunRecord` rows);
  `list_invites` / `revoke_invite` (`GET`/`DELETE /orgs/{id}/invites[/{id}]`, admin+). Full behavior:
  [multi-tenancy](../architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Agents (machine identities):** `create_agent` (`POST /orgs/{id}/agents`, admin+) mints/rotates a
  member token for a machine caller — its own `daily_call_cap`, `tool_access` and audit trail, with no
  new table; `list_agents` (`GET`, never returns a token) and `revoke_agent` (`DELETE …/{user_id}`,
  which also sweeps the deny rules and idempotent replay cache owned by that agent before deleting its
  membership; the schema cascades that cache as a backstop). An agent token is refused by
  `require_identity` and can never be an owner. **Re-POSTing the same name ROTATES, and a field the
  caller omits is left as it is** — a rotate changes the token, never the limits. `AgentIn` also takes
  `project_access` (slugs or ids), so an agent can be project-scoped at mint time; `created_by` stamps
  the minting admin. `GET /orgs/{id}/agents/observed` (admin+) lists the agents **detected in member
  traffic** — one row per (member, runtime) from `CallRecord.client`/`RunRecord.client` over 30 days,
  excluding plain-terminal (`''`/`cli`) and machine-identity traffic; attribution, never a gate. See
  [multi-tenancy](../architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Projects (a sub-scope inside the org):** `create_project` / `list_projects` /
  `delete_project` (`/orgs/{id}/projects`, admin+ to mutate) — deleting frees its tools to org-wide and
  removes the id from every member's `project_access`, leaving an emptied list as `[]` (NULL would mean
  *every* project). `POST /tools` and `PATCH /tools/{id}`
  take `project` (slug or id; null = org-wide), and `set_member_access` / `create_invite` take
  `project_access`. See [multi-tenancy](../architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **Deny rules (org policy):** `create_deny_rule` (`POST /orgs/{id}/deny`, admin+) blocks a
  host / path_prefix / method for the whole org, one member (`user_id`), and/or one project
  (`project_id` — fires only on calls through that project's tools); an all-empty rule is
  refused (it would freeze the org) and a full URL is reduced to its host. Plus `list_deny_rules`
  (`GET`) and `delete_deny_rule` (`DELETE …/{rule_id}`, 404 across orgs). Enforced on the proxy and
  both run tiers — see [proxy-model](../architecture/proxy-model.md). `GET /orgs/{id}/policy/cli-deny`
  (admin+, read-only) reports each CLI tool's effective argv deny patterns with their source (skill
  `treg.json` vs catalog) so the Policy screen shows every deny layer in one place.
- **Usage metering + caps** (usage-metering v1, `docs/USAGE-METERING-PLAN.md`): `org_usage`
  (`GET /orgs/{id}/usage?days=`, admin+) rolls up `CallRecord` + `RunRecord` since the window start into
  **by-user** (with a `call`/`local_run`/`server_run` split), **by-tool**, **by-day**, and totals — pure
  `GROUP BY`, **no request/response bodies** (they aren't stored). `set_member_cap`
  (`PATCH /orgs/{id}/members/{user}/cap`, admin+) sets `Membership.daily_call_cap` (`-1` = unlimited,
  rejects `< -1`). `my_usage` (`GET /usage/me`, any member) returns the caller's own `used_today` + `cap`.
  `list_members` also returns each member's `daily_call_cap` + `used_today`. **Enforcement:**
  `_enforce_daily_cap` runs at the top of `call_tool`, `run_tool_server`, and `grant_local_run` (so no
  path dodges the cap); `count_today` = today's `CallRecord` + `RunRecord` for the user. `-1` (default)
  skips the count entirely (zero overhead); the sandbox is exempt. **Soft by design** — it counts the
  best-effort `CallRecord`, so under load it fails *open*, never closed.
- **Super-admin (cross-tenant, `require_superadmin`):** `/admin/stats|orgs|orgs/{id}|users|tools|calls|
  errors|health` (reads — `errors` is failed calls across every credential tier with captured,
  admin-only request/response evidence, supports a `tier` filter, and runs the 14-day retention pass;
  see [super-admin](../architecture/super-admin.md))
  + `/admin/users/{id}/superadmin|suspend`, `DELETE /admin/users/{id}`,
  `/admin/orgs/{id}/suspend`, `DELETE /admin/orgs/{id}` (Phase-2). See
  [super-admin](../architecture/super-admin.md).
- **Secrets:** `create_secret` / `list_secrets` / `update_secret` (re-encrypts on value change) /
  `delete_secret` (409 if a tool binding references it). Values never returned (`_secret_view`).
- **Tools:** `create_tool` (bindings via `body.bindings`, or `_flat_binding(body)` sugar, or `[]`;
  validated by `_validate_bindings`; `host` derived by `_host_of`; optional `examples`; optional `cli`
  local-run profile validated by `_validate_cli_profile`), `list_tools`, `update_tool` (re-derives host on
  base_url change; `cli` set/clear here — this is how the local-run toggle flips `cli.enabled`),
  `delete_tool`. View via `_tool_view` (now includes `cli`). `delete_secret` refuses a secret referenced by
  a tool binding **or** a `cli.inject` entry.
  - **Owner-only binding.** `_validate_bindings` (HTTP bindings) and `_validate_cli_secrets` (local-run
    `cli.inject` entries) require the caller to **own** every secret they bind/inject, via
    `_require_secret_ownership`; only an **admin/owner** may wire up a shared-key tool with a teammate's
    secret. This stops a member laundering another member's key into a tool they control and then
    extracting it (through the proxy's `base_url` or a `/grant`). `update_tool` **grandfathers** the
    secrets already on the tool (it passes their ids as a `grandfather` set) — only a **newly-added**
    binding/inject is ownership-checked, so re-saving a tool an admin wired with a shared key doesn't lock
    its owner out on edit. The skill/folder importer runs the same checks.
  - **No SSRF at registration.** `_require_public_base_url` (reusing `health.safe_webhook_url`) rejects a
    `base_url` pointing at loopback / private / link-local / cloud-metadata hosts — including numeric IP
    encodings (decimal/hex/octal/short forms) — on `create_tool`, `update_tool`, and each imported skill
    tool, so a member can't turn `treg call` into a request to an internal address. The proxy also
    **re-resolves** the host at call time (`health.host_is_public`) to defeat DNS rebinding — see
    [proxy-model](../architecture/proxy-model.md).
- **Local runs (`treg run --local`, see [local-run](../architecture/local-run.md)):** `grant_local_run`
  (`POST /tools/{name}/grant`) is the one audited, owner-opt-in exception to "values are never returned" —
  member+ only (a viewer may call but not extract a value). It matches the catalog profile
  (`providers.match_skill`), server-side deny-checks the argv, renders the credential (oauth → leaf only),
  and writes a synchronous `GRANT`/`DENY` audit row (argv redacted of key-shaped tokens by `_redact_argv`).
  **Runner-proof gate:** returning a secret the caller does **not** own (a shared-key tool they may run but
  not read) requires the header `X-Treg-Run-Proof` to equal `TREG_RUN_PROOF` — the value held only by the
  isolated `treg-run` runner, which the member's own uid can't read. A caller who owns the injected secret
  (or is an admin) skips the gate. On refusal a `DENY` audit row is written and the grant is 403'd, so a
  direct member call can never read a teammate's key value. The grant response also carries
  **`redact_output`** (true exactly when the caller doesn't own the key, i.e. the runner-proof case) — the
  client then scrubs the injected value from the CLI's output (see [local-run](../architecture/local-run.md)).
  `report_local_run` (`POST /tools/{name}/run-report`) takes the client's verdict enum (never raw output);
  `credential_invalid` marks the injected secret(s) invalid via the health fields, skipping `param` kind.
- **Server runs (`treg run --server`, Tier 0):** `POST /run` runs a **runnable bundle's** CLI on the
  server via `runner.run_bundle` (secrets injected into a scrubbed child env, per-run temp `$HOME`, argv
  array — no shell), returns `{stdout, stderr, exit_code, timed_out}` and writes a `RunRecord`. `GET /runs`
  (`list_runs`) is now a **unified** execution log: it merges server `RunRecord`s with local-run `GRANT`
  `CallRecord`s, each tagged `where` (`server`|`local`), ids prefixed `s`/`l`, newest first (a local
  success has a null `exit_code`, since only failures report back). Bundle run-metadata (`runtime`/`package`/`entrypoint`/`runnable`) is set via
  `PATCH /bundles/{id}` (CLI `skill runtime`). **Command allow-list:** the bundle's exec command
  (`entrypoint`/`package`/name) must be a **catalog-known CLI** or an admin-listed one in
  `TREG_RUN_ALLOWED_BINS` (`_allowed_server_bins`); naming `bash`/`python` to run arbitrary code as the
  server user is 422'd (`--local` is the path for anything else). Run-metadata command names are also shape-
  checked by `_validate_run_meta` (plain command name — no path separators, spaces, or shell characters).
  The sandbox is excluded, and `/run` is member+ (executing argv server-side is a register-tier capability).
  - **Resource-limit sandbox (`runner.py`, the DoS half of the server-run sandbox):** every server-run
    child is spawned with POSIX rlimits via a `preexec_fn` (`_spawn_preexec`/`_rlimit_preexec`) — a
    CPU-seconds cap, a max-file-size cap, and core dumps disabled (a core would spill the injected secret
    to disk). Env-gated (`TREG_RUN_RLIMITS` on by default; `TREG_RUN_CPU_SECONDS`, `TREG_RUN_FSIZE_MB`),
    a no-op where `resource` is unavailable. Deliberately **no** address-space or process-count cap — a
    virtual-memory cap crashes Go CLIs (gh/stripe/doctl) and `RLIMIT_NPROC` is per-uid, shared with the
    server. Full **filesystem/network** isolation needs a container deploy and is a planned follow-up.
- **Meta:** `meta` (`GET /meta`, open) → `{public_url, github, google, app_version, treg_version,
  posthog_key/posthog_host, intercom_app_id}` for the dashboard. The last three are the opt-in
  third-party keys (analytics, support chat): empty on a deployment that didn't set them, so
  self-hosted pages load neither PostHog nor the Intercom Messenger. `intercom_app_id` is paired
  server-side with `intercom_secret`, which never leaves the server: `_intercom_user_hash` (HMAC-SHA256
  of the email, keyed by the secret) is added to `GET /auth/me` as `intercom_user_hash` — Intercom
  identity verification, so a third party who knows an email can't impersonate that user in chat.
- **Provider catalog:** `providers_catalog` (`GET /providers.json`, open) → `{version, providers}` — the
  catalog `treg upload` uses to detect env keys → tools; served so the CLI can refresh centrally. See
  [env-import](env-import.md).
- **Endpoint catalog** (open, and now **in** the OpenAPI schema — these four are the public read API,
  so they are documented rather than hidden; read via `catalog_store`): the operations layer
  — what a connected provider can DO. `catalog_platforms` (`GET /catalog/platforms`) → `{platforms:
  [{slug, label, capabilities, endpoints, verified, providers[]}], generated_from: "catalog"}`, endpoint
  count desc, platforms nobody implements omitted. `catalog_platform` (`GET /catalog/platforms/{slug}`,
  404 unknown) → `{platform:{slug,label}, capabilities:[{id, description, endpoints[]}] (sorted by id),
  extended:[…], domains:[…], providers:{…}}` where an endpoint is `{id, provider, provider_display,
  summary, method, path, scope, tier, domain, call_template, cost, verified, docs_url, has_example,
  input}` — grouping by capability is what makes two providers' take on one job comparable;
  capability-less endpoints fall to `extended`. **Two axes, both served**: `capabilities`/`extended` is
  the shape `treg catalog` renders; `domains` is the LEDGER the dashboard renders —
  `[{domain, rows:[{kind:"merged"|"single", capability?, description, domain, endpoints[]}]}]`, sections
  ordered `other`-last then busiest-first, merged rows (a job ≥2 providers do) before single rows within
  a section, a single row described by its ENDPOINT's summary rather than the capability's. Ordering and
  merging happen server-side (`catalog_store.domain_rows`) so every client shows the same page. Every
  endpoint carries the `domain` that files it (`catalog_store._domain`: explicit `domain:` → the
  capability id's middle segment → a path keyword → the path's grouping segment → `other`) and a
  paste-ready `call_template`. `providers` maps service → `{service, display_name, limits?,
  pricing_url?, docs?}`, once per provider, for an expanded row. `catalog_example`
  (`GET /catalog/examples/{endpoint_id}`) streams the captured response JSON — the id is resolved
  through the loaded catalog **before** any path is built, so caller input never reaches the filesystem
  (404 otherwise). Consumed by the dashboard and `treg catalog`; see
  [catalog](../architecture/catalog.md).
- **Catalog discover → inspect** (open, same section): the two routes that complete the loop whose third
  step is `treg call`. `catalog_search` (`GET /catalog/search?q=&limit=` , default 25, capped 100) →
  `{query, count, total, results[], hints[]}`; a result is the endpoint view **plus** `{capability,
  capability_description, platform, platform_label, score}`; a routed parent (`kind: routed`) rides in
  whenever one of its children matched and carries `children_hidden` when its group was capped at 5
  (`catalog_store.MAX_ROUTED_CHILDREN`; the full ranked list is `catalog_get`'s plan). Ranking is plain token containment
  (`catalog_store.search`, no deps, no embeddings): **most** query tokens must match — a query may miss
  one token in three, so a second word still narrows (1–2 words: all required) while an agent's
  seven-word sentence survives its filler. Function words, single letters and tokens matching >25%
  of the catalog are never REQUIRED (the last still score where they match), and a token also matches
  through its `aliases.yaml` synonyms ("cryptocurrency" → "crypto"), at the same weight. A
  zero-result answer carries `near` — the rows just under the gate and the exact unmatched words —
  over MCP, the HTTP route, and as "almost:" lines in `treg catalog search`. Each matched
  token scores its best field weight — capability id/description + platform label/slug (3) >
  summary (2) > id/path/provider (1) — times its BM25 idf, so rare words decide the order (a
  platform-slug token scores double where it matches — the platform is the caller's hard filter). Ties —
  still the COMMON case, since rows matching the same tokens in the same fields sum identical
  floats — are then settled by `catalog_store.rerank()` over
  the band `rank_band()` returns (the whole equal-scoring group at the cut, capped at `RERANK_BAND`
  with a hint when that cap bites), on **measured reliability, then core-before-extended, then price**, with
  `verified` and id keeping the order total; each result carries the `observed` block that decided it.
  Reliability is an optional endpoint-level process cache rather than a request DB dependency:
  entries are fresh for five minutes, served stale while refreshing through thirty minutes, then
  omitted. Cold-start and database-failure requests still answer 200 without reliability weighting;
  one process-level refresh Task uses its own short session, so `/catalog/search` checks out zero DB
  connections regardless of search concurrency.
  See [catalog](../architecture/catalog.md#the-evidence-decides-the-order-not-just-the-detail-page).
  `catalog_endpoint` (`GET /catalog/endpoints/{endpoint_id}`) answers everything in ONE round-trip:
  `{endpoint, provider:{service, display_name, limits?, pricing_url?, docs?}, siblings[], call_template,
  example_response, hints[]}` — `siblings` are the other providers implementing the same capability (so a
  price/verification comparison needs no second call), `example_response` is inlined rather than left
  behind `/catalog/examples`, and `call_template` is a paste-ready `treg call …` line built from the
  endpoint's `test_request` (the request the verifier actually ran) falling back to documented examples.
  `hints` on both routes carries the next command, since finding an endpoint is never the goal.
  An unknown id 404s with `{error, hint, did_you_mean[]}` rather than a bare string: an id is not
  free text, and one that misses by a segment (`lusha.companies-signals` for
  `lusha.x.companies-signals` — what a model produces relaying an id through a summary) broke the
  loop at its first step, whereupon the usual next move is to invent another id and fail again.
  `catalog_store.near_ids()` matches on segment overlap ignoring the tier marker; no near miss means
  an empty list and a search hint, never a confidently wrong suggestion. `/call/` answers the same
  way for a dotted target that misses — the branch where money is on the line used to reply "no tool
  … in this org", describing the wrong half of treg. A known endpoint marked `retired` or `broken`
  remains inspectable here with `status_note` and optional `superseded_by`, but is absent from every
  discovery list. Calling it—or asking `/catalog/endpoints/{id}/access` whether it is callable—returns
  an actionable 410. The `/call/` refusal is recorded with `refused_by=retired` and never reaches a
  provider credential or relay.
  A row can also carry `platform_blocked` — the route works upstream but treg's own subscription
  cannot serve it (Akta's alternative-data tier). Those rows STAY in discovery (a caller's own key
  may serve them) but are never platform offers, and the reason string rides on the served row.
  A zero-result search additionally points at **`POST /tool-requests`** (open, per-IP rate-limited,
  fields capped): file what the catalog is missing — stored as a `ToolRequest` row (see
  [data-model](../architecture/data-model.md)) with identity attached only when the caller happens
  to be signed in (token, or same-origin session; a cross-origin cookie POST stores anonymously
  rather than being rejected). The zero-result caller is exactly the demand signal the catalog team
  wants, so no signup wall. The miss itself is also logged as a `SearchMiss` row (fire-and-forget
  via `audit.record_search_miss`, from this route and from the MCP `catalog_search` tool alike) —
  most missing agents never file a request, and the queries they leave behind are what
  `scripts/usage_report.py` reports as un-served demand. MCP rows use `mcp` for the team MCP and
  `claude-connector` for V2, so reports can separate the two surfaces.
- **Auth — three identity doors** (all resolve to a user via the shared `_find_or_create_user`, so
  first-proof = registration — the **user only, no auto personal org**; a brand-new user lands with zero
  teams and names their first via the mandatory welcome / `treg org create`): **GitHub** — `auth_github` (`GET /auth/github`,
  `?cli=<id>` for the CLI handshake), `auth_github_callback` (browser → signed cookie, CLI → stashes an
  identity token), `auth_cli_poll` (`GET /auth/cli/poll?login_id=<id>` → the CLI collects its identity
  token once; **carries no code** — nothing to brute-force). **The handshake starts server-side** —
  `auth_cli_start` (`POST /auth/cli/start`, unauthenticated) mints BOTH the `login_id` and a short
  **pairing code** (`_PAIR_ALPHABET`, 4 chars) held in `_cli_pending`; `treg login` shows the code only in
  the terminal (never in the URL). **The universal sign-in page** — `login_page` (`GET /login?cli=<id>`, the page `treg login` opens; no
  `cli` → redirect to `/`; the id is whitelist-validated by `_LOGIN_ID_RE`, which is also the XSS guard
  since it's echoed into the page's JS): with a live session it shows a **team picker** (the JS
  `loadOrgs` fetches `auth_cli_orgs` — `GET /auth/cli/orgs`, session-authed, `_orgs_brief` returns the
  user's teams sorted **team-first, personal-last, most-tools-first**; one team → a single "Continue as"
  button, many → a labelled list; **zero teams → an inline "name your team" input** (`createTeam` → `POST
  /orgs` → approve with the new slug) so a brand-new CLI login never completes team-less), else every configured door (GitHub/Google buttons link to the `?cli=`
  flows; the email form drives `auth_email_start`/`verify` then loads the picker — always present, so
  login works with no OAuth app configured). `auth_cli_approve` (`POST /auth/cli/approve`,
  session-cookie-authed) completes the handshake by stashing the identity token under the given
  `login_id`, plus the **`org`** the user picked (validated to be one of their memberships) as
  `active_org` in the poll result — so the CLI lands on the RIGHT team instead of guessing. It requires
  the **pairing code** to be typed into the page (`#paircode`) and validates it against `_cli_pending`
  server-side (`_norm_pair_code`, case-insensitive; `CLI_APPROVE_MAX_TRIES` wrong tries then the pending
  login is discarded) — so a mistyped code fails immediately in the browser, and a **phished**
  `/login?cli=<attacker-id>` link (whose code the victim doesn't have, or that was never `start`ed) can
  never complete. Deliberately a POST guarded by `_same_origin` (Origin must be the configured
  `public_url` **or** the request's own host — public_url alone broke localhost). The GitHub/Google
  callbacks validate cookie/query state before resolving the shared HTTP client; `_finish_oauth_login`
  sets the session cookie and bounces to `/login?cli=<id>` for the shared picker. `auth_logout`
  uses the same `_same_origin` guard.
  **Google** — `auth_google` / `auth_google_callback` (`GET /auth/google[/callback]`): the same
  session + CLI-handshake plumbing as GitHub (token from `google_token_url`, email from
  `google_userinfo_url`), gated on `google_client_id` and surfaced via `/meta`'s `google` flag. The
  callback now **requires `email_verified`** on the Google profile (like the GitHub door) — identity is
  keyed by email, so an unverified Google address equal to a victim's registered email would otherwise
  resolve to the victim (account takeover).
  **Email one-time code** — `auth_email_start` (`POST /auth/email/start`, mints a 6-digit code stored
  **in the DB** — `ratestore` over the `Ephemeral` table, namespace `otp`; the `dev_code` is put in the
  response + logged **only** when `get_settings().expose_dev_code` — true on a local sqlite box, never on
  a real Postgres deploy — otherwise the code is **emailed via Resend** — `email.send_otp`, best-effort)
  and `auth_email_verify` (`POST /auth/email/verify` → mints an identity token **and** sets the session
  cookie, so the CLI and dashboard share one endpoint). A wrong code burns one of `MAX_OTP_ATTEMPTS`
  before the code dies (brute-force cap). `/start` is **rate-limited** per-email AND per-IP
  (`ratestore.rate_check` sliding window in namespace `otp_start`, `OTP_START_MAX_PER_EMAIL`/`_PER_IP`) so
  it can't email-bomb an inbox or reset the attempt counter at will. **All this — the code, its attempt
  counter, and the throttle windows — is DB-backed (backlog #3), so a restart can't reset the caps and
  they stay correct across instances** (rows are swept by `expires_at` + `ratestore.sweep`; the landing
  `/demo/sandbox` throttle shares the same table, namespace `sandbox_hit`). The one remaining in-process
  piece is the short-lived CLI-login handshake (`_cli_pending`, self-heals on retry). A **suspended**
  account is refused at every door. **Invite sign-in link** —
  an invite carries TWO split secrets (`models.Invite`): the admin-visible `code` (returned from
  `create_invite` for out-of-band relay — join-only, NEVER an auth factor, since the admin provably
  holds it) and an inbox-only `email_token` (stored as `email_token_hash`, embedded ONLY in the email's
  link — possession proves inbox access, the same bar as the emailed OTP). `auth_invite_signin`
  (`GET /auth/invite-signin?t=<email_token>`, the email button): the GET renders a **confirm page**
  only (mail scanners prefetch GETs; a one-time credential must survive that) — the page's button
  POSTs the token back, and `auth_invite_signin_confirm` (`POST /auth/invite-signin`, urlencoded form
  parsed by hand to avoid the python-multipart dep) re-validates, `_find_or_create_user`s, refuses the
  suspended, **consumes the token** (`email_token_hash=None`, one-time) and mints the session cookie →
  303 `/?invite_org=<org_id>` (the dashboard opens its multi-select accept modal on that org). The
  invite itself stays `pending` — acceptance happens in the app so a multi-team invitee can accept
  several at once. The **legacy `?code=` path stays**: it never mints a session — validate and 303 to
  `/?invite=<email>` (a prefilled normal login; the invitee proves the email at a real door and the
  invite auto-appears via `/invites/mine`, now **ordered newest-first + `created_at`**). Invalid/expired
  either way → `/?invite_expired=1`. `auth_me`
  (`GET /auth/me`) answers for a **token**
  (`X-Treg-Token`) as well as a session cookie, so the dashboard's token door can learn its own email.
  `auth_cli_token` (`GET /auth/cli-token`, `require_identity`) delegates token minting and optional team
  pinning to `application.auth.issue_cli_token`; the dashboard embeds the fresh **identity token** in
  copy-paste snippets and its "copy token" button. New signed credentials carry both **`tv`
  (token_version)** and a signed **`aud`**: `make_session` emits `aud=session` plus a required expiry;
  `make_identity` emits `aud=identity`, with no expiry for copied API keys. `_user_from_session` uses
  `read_session_claims` and `_user_from_identity_token` uses `read_identity_claims`, so a typed session
  is never a bearer and a typed identity token is never a browser login. The one intentionally
  time-bounded identity is MCP's 120-second internal OAuth exchange token; its explicit `exp` is enforced.

  Legacy untyped credentials cannot be classified perfectly. A signed `org` claim proves a team-pinned
  copied key, so those launch-era keys survive their old 30-day `exp`; an untyped no-`exp` key is also
  identity-only. An org-less untyped token with `exp` could be either a copied key or a session cookie,
  so compatibility lasts only until `exp` and the bearer path refuses it afterward. Revocation is
  `token_version`, never the clock for permanent identity keys. `auth_revoke_tokens` (`POST /auth/revoke-tokens`, `require_identity`)
  delegates to `application.auth.revoke_identity_tokens`, which bumps `User.token_version` and invalidates
  every token that user holds at once; this kill switch keeps the account active and
  affects only that user; it re-issues a fresh cookie + token so the caller stays signed in. A token with
  no `tv` (minted before this shipped) reads as `tv=0`, so a plain deploy revokes nobody.
  Plus `auth_me` (returns `onboarded`), `auth_logout`, and **onboarding** — `POST /onboard/demo|skip|reset`
  (`require_identity`) seed/dismiss/remove a first-run demo team (see [onboarding](onboarding.md)). Triple resolution: `require_identity`/`require_member`/
  `require_superadmin` accept a per-org **token**, a signed **identity token** (bearer, from `treg login`)
  + `X-Treg-Org`, or the browser **session cookie** + `X-Treg-Org`. See [dashboard](dashboard.md) + [cli](cli.md).
- **Static (dashboard + tutorials):** `dashboard` (`GET /`, `FileResponse` + `Cache-Control: no-cache`),
  `tutorial_js` (`GET /tutorial.js` — shared `window.TREG_TUTORIAL` + `hl()`), `tutorial_page`
  (`GET /tutorial` — standalone CLI tutorial). The **dashboard tour** is a `StaticFiles(html=True)` mount
  at `/dashboard-tour/` (serves `web/tour/` — `tour.js`, the standalone `index.html`, and the WebP
  `img/`). **Vendored front-end libraries** are an `_ImmutableStatic` mount at `/vendor/` (serves
  `web/vendor/` — today just Vue, version-pinned in the filename, hence `Cache-Control: immutable`):
  the dashboard must not depend on a CDN a visitor's network may not reach, see
  [dashboard](dashboard.md). `favicon` (`GET /favicon.svg` + `/favicon.ico`). `llms_txt` (`GET /llms.txt`) serves
  `web/llms.txt` as `text/plain` with `{BASE}` templated from `public_url` — the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org)
  agent-onboarding file (call protocol + discovery + auth + CLI + skills + doc links). See [dashboard](dashboard.md).
  `install_sh` (`GET /install.sh`, `{BASE}`-templated) serves the CLI installer (`web/install.sh`).
  `sitetrack_js` (`GET /sitetrack.js`, no-cache) serves `web/sitetrack.js` with `{POSTHOG_KEY}` /
  `{POSTHOG_HOST}` templated from settings: the always-on first-party `treg_utm` first-touch cookie
  (utm_* + referring host, read by `_utm_attribution_from` / `_stamp_utm` in BOTH signup doors, `/users`
  and `/orgs`) plus the PostHog bootstrap with pageviews ON. Loaded by every public page — landing,
  use-case pages, resources, tutorial, and the SPA — so analytics sees the visitor's first hop rather
  than the post-OAuth `/app` landing. Without a key the analytics half is inert (empty string).
  `adtrack_js` (`GET /adtrack.js`, no-cache) serves the first-party ad-click capture script loaded by
  `index.html`'s `<script src="/adtrack.js">`; it returns an empty script when conversion tracking is
  disabled, so unconfigured deployments do not collect advertising cookies. See
  [ads-conversions](../architecture/ads-conversions.md).
  `well_known_skills_index` (`GET /.well-known/skills/index.json`) + `well_known_skill_md`
  (`GET /.well-known/skills/treg/SKILL.md`) advertise treg's own skill under the agentskills.io
  convention, making **this host** a skill source with no registry in between (Hermes reads it
  directly). The index's `description` comes from the skill's frontmatter at request time via
  `_skill_frontmatter()` — never a second copy — and the SKILL.md route is the same `_serve_md` as
  `/skill.md`, so `{BASE}` templates to the **serving** host and a self-hosted registry advertises
  itself. See [skill.md](skill.md) for the other three distribution doors.
  `terms_page` (`GET /terms`) + `privacy_page` (`GET /privacy`) serve the hosted registry's legal pages
  (`_legal_page`, no-cache) with `legal_css` (`GET /legal.css`) as the shared skin — `/privacy` is also
  the URL given to OAuth providers at app-verification time, so don't rename it.
  `resources_page` (`GET /resources`) is the hub for the outcome pages and the **only** thing linking to
  them: the landing footer and each page's own footer carry one `resources` link rather than five that grow
  with the cluster, and without the hub every `/use-cases/*` page is an orphan no crawler reaches.
  `resources.html` is generated alongside them, so a new page appears on the hub automatically.
  `use_case_page` (`GET /use-cases/{slug}`) serves the per-vertical **outcome landing pages** — the
  destinations for search ads and the organic `/use-cases/` cluster — off the `_USE_CASES` slug map, with
  `usecase_css` (`GET /usecase.css`) as their shared skin, the same split as the legal pages. Two
  deliberate differences from `/`: an unknown slug is a **404 rather than a fall-through** to the SPA (a
  typo in a live ad should be visible, not silently swallowed), and a signed-in visitor is **not**
  redirected to `/app` — bouncing a returning user off the page an ad paid to reach would make the
  campaign data unreadable. The HTML in `web/usecase-*.html` is **generated** from
  `marketing/landing/*.md` by that directory's `build.py` + `build_html.py`; never hand-edit it, and note
  the generator refuses to emit anything past the ad-kit heading so bid and negative keywords cannot
  reach a public page. Provider brand marks are
  mounted at `/logos` (`StaticFiles` over `web/logos/`, resolved by convention `logos/<service>.svg`).
  `dashboard_marketplace` (`GET /app/marketplace/{service}`) serves the plain SPA (a connect page is only
  meaningful to a signed-in member, so no OG meta).
  `_serve_md` backs `quickstart_md` (`GET /quickstart.md`) + `tutorial_md` (`GET /tutorial.md`) —
  `{BASE}`-templated markdown served as inline `text/plain` (so "open in new tab" shows it, not a
  download); the docs pages' **Copy markdown** dropdowns (copy / open-in-tab) fetch these.
  `vendor_listing_md` (`GET /vendor-listing`, alias `/vendor-listing.md`) serves the same way: the
  instructions a VENDOR's own coding agent follows to raise a listing PR on the repo (the dashboard's
  "List as vendor" modal hands vendors a prompt naming this URL; the repo-side counterpart is
  `docs/VENDORS.md`).
  Browser-facing auth pages (GitHub callback, OAuth-connect result) render via `_auth_page` (brand card).
- **Landing sandbox + hosted skills:** `demo_sandbox_mint` (`POST /demo/sandbox`, open, per-IP
  rate-limited) mints an anonymous throwaway team (its response now carries `live` = whether the seeded
  stripe tool is a real wire); `demo_sandbox_skill` (`GET /demo/sandbox/skill`) exports what the visitor
  built. `skill_samples` (`GET /skills/samples`, open) + `skill_install`
  (`GET /skills/{name}/install.sh?token=`) host sample skills. `call_tool` short-circuits **sandbox**
  orgs to `sandbox.synthesize` (real injection, no network). Caps via
`domain.governance.sandbox.enforce_sandbox_cap`. Full
  behavior: [landing-sandbox](landing-sandbox.md).
  - **The one live wire (real Stripe demo).** When `demo_stripe_key` is set, a sandbox call to the exact
    seeded `stripe` tool (fingerprint-matched by `demo_sandbox.is_live_tool`, GET/POST only) is relayed
    for real to Stripe's test API via `_relay_live_demo` — a deliberately narrower relay: the auth header
    is built from the env key (never from a sandbox secret, which doesn't hold it), the body is
    form-encoded, and `metadata[visitor]` is overridden server-side. Metered per client IP
    (`_enforce_public_demo_ip_cap`) since the wire is one shared credential. `demo_sandbox_live`
    (`GET /demo/sandbox/live`) reports `live` + the visitor's feed name for an existing sandbox.
    `_require_not_live_demo_tool`/`_require_not_live_demo_secret` freeze the seeded `stripe` tool and its
    `STRIPE_KEY` against edit/delete so a visitor can't break their own live pane. The public payments
    feed: `stripe_webhook` (`POST /stripe/webhook`, 404 when `demo_stripe_webhook_secret` unset, verifies
    the signature via `pubfeed.verify_signature`, pushes a `charge.succeeded` into `pubfeed.push_charge`)
    and `landing_stripe_feed` (`GET /landing/stripe-feed`, unauthenticated SSE via `pubfeed.stream`,
    server-chosen fields only).
- **Public demo token (publishable, call-only credential):** `create_public_token`
  (`POST /orgs/{id}/public-token`, owner-only) flips the org to `public_demo` and mints a **viewer-role**
  token bound to a dedicated can't-log-in identity (`pub-<slug>@public-demo.treg.local`) — safe to print
  on a web page. Re-POSTing **rotates** (instant revocation of the old one); `delete_public_token`
  (`DELETE …`) revokes and lifts the lockdown. **Lockdown is centralized in the auth deps:** when
  `org.public_demo` and the role is below admin, `require_member` allows only `/call/*` + GET/HEAD/OPTIONS
  (every mutation is frozen no matter what routes are added later), and `require_identity` refuses the
  token entirely (it must never act as a user — mint identity tokens, create orgs, accept invites). Its
  `/call` traffic is metered per client IP (`_enforce_public_demo_ip_cap`, `PUBLIC_DEMO_HIT_NS`,
  ~10 calls/min/IP) since one token stands in for thousands of strangers. The limiter and its
  constants share the `domain.governance.publicdemo` owner; the API commits its ratestore write before
  translating a semantic exhaustion result to 429.
- **Skills / bundles:** `register_skill` (`POST /skills`) composes a `Bundle` + its secrets + tools
  atomically, resolving each binding's `secret` local-name to the created secret id; the shared core is
  `_register_skill_bundle` (also used by the folder importer). `list_bundles`, `get_bundle`,
  `delete_bundle` (cascades; it 409s if a bundle secret is referenced by a tool **outside** the bundle —
  now guarding both an outside HTTP binding **and** an outside `cli.inject` entry, matching
  `delete_secret`, so a local-run tool can't be left with a dangling secret_id), and `update_bundle`
  (`PATCH /bundles/{id}`, creator/admin only) edits a recipe's SKILL.md text **and** the run-metadata
  (`runtime`/`package`/`entrypoint`/`runnable`). `_bundle_view`. **Folder importer** (dashboard mirror of `treg upload skills`):
  `analyze_skill_folder` (`POST /skills/analyze`) writes uploaded files to a temp dir and runs the CLI's
  own `skills.scan_skills`/`_classify` to classify each (recipe-only / contract / generated) **without**
  registering; `import_skill_folder` (`POST /skills/import`) scans + `build_payload`s + registers the
  selected ones (`_materialize_skill_files` sandboxes the upload). `list_orgs` now carries `tool_count`.
- **Audit:** `list_calls` (`GET /calls`, limit clamped 1–500; each row carries its `kind` —
  `call`/`local_run` — for the Activity + Usage views, and `refused_by` — non-null = treg refused
  pre-relay; see the data-model fragment — so `treg audit` can tell "the provider failed" from
  "we said no"). It does **not** carry `error_request`/`error_response`, and defers them so they are
  not even fetched: the captured evidence is admin-only in v1, and putting it on a team's own feed
  has to be a deliberate edit in two places rather than a column appearing by accident.
  A metered async submission audited its RESERVE as `cost_charged_micro`; both `list_calls` and
  `get_call` therefore join `application.asynctasks.views_for` on `call_ref` and add `async_task`
  (`status`, `task_id`, `reserved_micro`, `settled_micro`, `completed_at`, `error`, `result_url`,
  `fetch_command`, `ttl_note`) while `_async_charged` rewrites the charge to what actually hit the
  balance - `null` while pending, the settled figure (0 after a refund) at a terminal state.
  Each row also carries `has_result` — true when the archive holds this call's answer — and
  `get_call_result` (`GET /calls/{id}/result`, member, org-scoped by the row's `org_id`) returns
  it: the vendor-facing request shape BEFORE credential injection (`ArchiveKey.req_*`) and the
  stored answer (`ArchiveSnapshot`: status, media type, size, fetch time, `body_text`), resolved
  through the row's `archive_key_hash` + `archive_content_hash` by `archive.resolve_result`. Only
  a metered platform 2xx call ever has one; every other row answers `stored: false` with a `note`
  naming the case (own-key/own-tool never stored · failed · recording off · expired · hash-only
  because the licence or size cap kept the hash and not the bytes). The failure-evidence columns
  are still never read here (see [archive](../architecture/archive.md)).
- **OAuth connect + the provider marketplace:** `oauth_start` (`POST /oauth/start`) creates a
  `PendingOAuth` and returns `consent_url` + `state` + `redirect_uri` + registry-owned
  `connect_guidance`; `oauth_callback`
  (`GET /oauth/callback`, open) exchanges the code and creates/updates the oauth secret; `oauth_status`
  polls. **Two modes** (`OAuthStartIn`): **BYO** (supply `client_id`/`client_secret`/`auth_uri`/
  `token_uri`/`scopes`) or **REGISTRY** (supply `provider` + optional `capability`) where treg fills
  everything from **its own approved OAuth app** — the marketplace. `oauth_providers_list`
  (`GET /oauth/providers`) lists the providers treg holds an app for, each flagged `configured` (false
  when this deployment hasn't set that provider's client credentials) and `metered` (true when the
  provider's upstream bills treg's app per use AND this deployment charges for it — then
  `billed_rates` carries the default prices, so the UI can show them before consent; see
  [auth-secrets](../architecture/auth-secrets.md) on `platform_billed`). In registry mode `oauth_start`
  reads the provider from `oauth_providers.get`, resolves scopes via `scopes_for(capability)`, and
  stashes every per-provider auth quirk on the `PendingOAuth` (PKCE `code_verifier`, `auth_params`,
  `token_endpoint_auth_method`, `client_id_param`, `scope_separator`, `long_lived_exchange`) so the
  callback exchanges the code exactly the way the consent URL was built. `connection_id` (BYO or
  registry) targets ONE existing connection to **reconnect/widen** it — scoped to the caller's org and
  matched to the provider, recorded as `replaces_secret_id` — instead of adding another account.
  **Callback does the real work:** it either replaces the named connection (`replaces_secret_id`) or
  adds a new one named by `_free_connection_name` (the first account for a provider keeps the bare
  service name — `google-search-console` — later ones get `-2`/`-3`), normalizes `granted_scopes` to
  space-joined, sets `expires_at` (`oauth.expiry_of`), then `_autoprovision_provider_tool` binds the
  fresh credential to the provider's API as a callable tool (idempotent by (org, name); a token-kind
  provider gets an `env` header binding, an oauth one gets a `Bearer {access_token}` binding; a provider
  needing treg's own second credential — Google Ads' developer token — also gets a **platform binding**,
  see [proxy-model](../architecture/proxy-model.md)) and `_record_connected_identity` best-effort asks
  the provider who connected. `_upsert_provider_extra_tools` is shared by this connect path and the
  startup backfill, so companions use the same `(org_id, name)` upsert and binding shape in both cases.
  See [auth-secrets](../architecture/auth-secrets.md).
  The tool's `examples` come from `_provider_tool_examples`: the registry's hand-written ones first,
  then the endpoint catalog's **verified core** endpoints for that provider (`catalog_store.tool_examples`
  → `{method, path, note}` where the note carries the summary, required params and capability),
  de-duplicated by (method, path) and capped at `CATALOG_STAMP_CAP` (12). Unverified endpoints are never
  stamped — an example is a promise the call works, and the `verified` date is the only evidence of that.
  Search Console's hand-written example additionally documents that direct own-tool path substitution
  takes a `site_url` encoded exactly once; catalog calls accept either raw values or existing `%HH`
  escapes and prevent the latter from being encoded a second time.
- **Connections (the marketplace's dashboard surface):** `list_connections` (`GET /connections`) returns
  every OAuth/registry credential in the org — metadata only, no token material — with health, expiry,
  and (for a known provider) `capabilities`/`missing_capabilities` + extra-credential notes. The filter
  is `kind=="oauth" OR provider!=""` so a bring-your-own-token provider (a plain `env` string, e.g.
  Slack) still lists. `connection_resources` (`GET /connections/{id}/resources`) **live-fetches** what a
  connection can act on (GSC sites, GA properties, Ads accounts), enriching id-only rows with the
  upstream's human name concurrently (`_enrich_resource_labels`) and recording the successful upstream
  call as proof of health. For providers declaring `discover_extra_path` (the Meta pair) it also walks
  the Business graph and merges Business-owned rows after the primary ones — deduped by id, id-less
  rows dropped, and a failing walk swallowed rather than surfaced as a 502; `set_connection_resource` (`POST …/resource`) pins the chosen `resource_ref`
  + `resource_name`. `connect_with_token` (`POST /connections/token`) connects any **pasted-secret**
  provider — a bring-your-own bot token (Slack) or an **API key** (Apollo, Hunter, TikHub, Semrush, …) —
  **verifying the credential against the provider's probe before storing** (a header- OR query-param probe,
  an off-host `probe_url`, tolerating a CSV/text body or a 200-with-false-`token_verify_field` reply), then
  auto-provisioning its tool with a header or query binding. Two probe subtleties the code handles
  because upstreams don't cooperate: a `probe_path` may bake in a required `?query` (PDL, Akta,
  JustOneAPI, SpyFu), and httpx **replaces** a URL's own query when `params=` is passed — so the path's
  query is parsed out and **merged into params** (the credential wins a key collision) rather than
  silently dropped; and the body is parsed as JSON **regardless of content-type**, because ScrapeCreators
  serves real JSON under `text/plain` and gating on `application/json` left `token_verify_field` unread
  (a genuinely non-JSON balance still throws → empty payload → the `ERROR`-text branch, unchanged). A
  base64-encode provider (`token_encode`, DataForSEO/Moz) accepts EITHER a raw `login:password` OR the
  dashboard's ready-made base64 blob — a blob is detected (strict-decodes to printable text with a `:`)
  and kept as-is instead of being double-encoded. See
  [auth-secrets](../architecture/auth-secrets.md). `set_extra_credential` (`POST /connections/{id}/extra-credential`) stores
  the second credential a provider needs when treg does NOT hold it centrally (Tomba's `X-Tomba-Secret`)
  and finishes the tool with BOTH bindings — the primary half built by `_provider_bindings`, so it
  follows the provider's own auth shape (pasted key or OAuth) rather than assuming a bearer token. `revoke_connection` (`DELETE /connections/{id}`) deletes the credential and
  cleans up: it removes the tool treg auto-provisioned for the provider and drops the dead binding from
  any user-built tool, leaving that tool's other bindings intact. All `require_can_register`
  (member+). Helpers: `_owned_connection`, `_dig` (dotted-path walk).
- **Health:** `run_health` (`POST /health/run`) → `health.run_all`; `get_health` (`GET /health`) now
  returns `health._view(s)` plus a `needs_reconnect` flag (`health.needs_reconnect`) so a credential treg
  can't renew announces itself before it dies.
- **The proxy:** `routers.call.call_tool` (`* /call/{rest:path}`) captures a framework-neutral
  `CallInput` → `application.call.service.execute_call` → `application.call.resolve` → (on a dotted 404,
  catalog lookup + retirement gate + credential ladder) → `application.call.authorize` (tool/project ACL,
  deny, per-user cap, then public-demo rate cap) → load secrets
  (+ `ensure_fresh`) → **`db.commit()` — the DB phase ends here; a call in flight holds no pooled
  connection** → `relay()` → `audit.record_call`. A pool that has no slot within 5 s answers
  `503 {"treg_saturated": true}` + `Retry-After: 2` (`_pool_saturated`, the handler for
  `sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError`) rather than a 30 s wait and an anonymous 500. The adapter also calls
  `analytics.capture_fault(component="db_pool")`: saturation is a handled, typed response for the caller
  but remains an infrastructure fault for PostHog alerting. After identity resolution it also emits
  one `tool_called` event with `outcome=gateway_failed` and `failure_kind=db_pool`. During identity
  resolution it emits `call_intake_failed` instead, without team or target attribution and with a
  `call` or `catalog_call` surface label. The same compensation applies to `/catalog/call/`, including
  release of an acquired idempotency label so a retry does not get a false 409. An unexpected
  exception raised while `call_tool` awaits `execute_call` emits `tool_called` with the same outcome
  and `failure_kind=unexpected_exception`. A **platform binding** carries no `secret_id`
  (its value comes from settings at relay time), so secret-loading now skips `secret_id is None`. Detail
  in [proxy-model](../architecture/proxy-model.md).
  `call_catalog_endpoint` (`* /catalog/call/{rest:path}`, hidden from public OpenAPI) is the narrower
  internal entrance used by catalog-only MCP surfaces: it requires an exact catalog id and skips
  `_resolve_call`, so an exact same-named team tool cannot shadow the catalog endpoint. From the
  credential ladder onward it delegates to `call_tool`, retaining provider/user credentials, ACLs,
  deny rules, caps, metering, audit, idempotency and faithful relay.

  A resolved catalog endpoint with an async descriptor adds one treg-owned response header:
  `X-Treg-Async`, containing compact JSON for the already-known effective descriptor. The router
  attaches it after catalog resolution and before Starlette begins streaming; no provider response
  bytes are read, parsed, or rewritten.

## Schemas
Pydantic input models: `UserIn`, `OrgIn` / `InviteIn` / `AcceptIn`, `EmailStartIn` / `EmailVerifyIn`,
`SecretIn` / `SecretUpdate`,
`ToolIn` (flat single-binding sugar + optional `bindings` + `health_check` + `cli`) / `ToolUpdate` (incl.
`cli`), `SkillIn` (`SkillSecretIn` + `SkillToolIn`, whose `cli` inject entries reference secrets by
local_name), `GrantIn` (argv) / `RunReportIn` (audit_id + exit_code + verdict), `OAuthStartIn` (now
BYO-or-registry: `provider` / `capability` / `connection_id` plus the BYO `client_id`/`secret`/URIs/
`scopes`), and the connection models `ResourceRefIn`, `TokenConnectIn`, `ExtraCredentialIn`. Output
helpers `_secret_view` / `_tool_view` / `_bundle_view` never leak secret values — `_tool_view` returns
`health_check` + `examples` + `cli` (it once omitted `health_check`, so a tool's probe was stored but never
surfaced by `GET /tools` / `/bundles/{id}`).

## Cross-cutting hardening (bug-hunt)
- **Legacy-host redirect:** `_LegacyHostRedirectMiddleware` 301s GET/HEAD marketing pages (`_REDIRECT_PATHS`)
  from the legacy hosts (`config.LEGACY_PUBLIC_HOSTS`) to the canonical `public_url` host (`treg.to`)
  — but only for **anonymous** visitors: a `treg_session` cookie is host-scoped, so a signed-in
  browser (e.g. the invite flow landing on `/?invite_org=…`) is served in place. The auth entries
  `/auth/github`, `/auth/google` and GET `/oauth/authorize` (`_REDIRECT_ALWAYS`) redirect
  unconditionally and with a **302** (one-shot OAuth params must not be cached as permanent) —
  each parks a host-scoped cookie (CSRF state / `treg_oauth_return`) that the flow's continuation
  on `public_url` must be able to read. Everything else is served in
  place on BOTH hosts, forever: installed CLIs/skills hold tokens pointed at the legacy host, HTTP
  clients strip `Authorization` on a cross-host redirect, `/vendor-listing` is fetched by agents,
  and `curl {BASE}/install.sh | sh` runs without `-L`. The legacy names also stay in MCP's
  transport allow-lists (`mcp._allowed_hosts`/`_allowed_origins`) and in the OAuth token-audience
  set (`mcp_oauth.mcp_resource_audiences()` — pre-move grants keep their old audience for life,
  and refresh reissues it). Never remove the legacy domain from Render.
- **Security headers:** pure-ASGI `_SecurityHeadersMiddleware` adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options:
  DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and HSTS to every response (`setdefault`, so the `/call`
  proxy's stricter CSP/nosniff wins).
- **No 500 on bad ids/URLs:** an `OverflowError` handler turns an oversized all-digit id into a `404`
  (SQLite's 64-bit INTEGER); `_host_of`/`_resolve_call` guard `urlsplit` `ValueError` (malformed
  `base_url`/passthrough) into a `422`/`400`.
- **CSRF/redirect:** `auth_logout` rejects a cross-`Origin` request (forced-logout CSRF); `oauth_start`
  pins `redirect_uri` to treg's own `/oauth/callback` (consent-phishing guard).
- **Destructive routes name their target:** `DELETE /orgs/{id}` requires `?confirm=<slug>` and 422s
  without it. It is irreversible and sits one path segment above every other org route, so any client
  that normalizes `..` turns `DELETE /orgs/{id}/<anything>/..` into it — `treg org unpin ..` really
  did delete a team in testing, because httpx rewrites the path before the request is sent. Server-
  side validation cannot see that, so the defence is the confirmation, plus keeping user-supplied
  values out of path segments (the pin capability moved to a query parameter for the same reason).
  The CLI and the dashboard already made a human type the slug; now the API insists too.
- **A machine identity can learn its own org:** `GET /auth/me` returns `org_id`/`org`/`role` when the
  caller authenticated with a token. `require_identity` refuses machine identities on `/orgs` by
  design (`create_org` hangs off it, so an agent could otherwise mint an org it owns) — but its token
  IS one membership, and without this every `/orgs/{id}/…` command died with "no active org" for
  exactly the callers those commands serve.
- **Config default:** returning the OTP in the response (`dev_code`) is now gated by a dedicated
  `expose_dev_code` — true only on a local sqlite box, never on a real (Postgres) deploy — so a
  misconfigured `email_dev_mode` can't leak the code and enable an unauth takeover in prod.

Full endpoint list + the running server's OpenAPI: `README.md` and `/docs`. CLI-level usage: `USAGE.md`.

`/docs` is **ours** — a server-rendered reference built from `app.openapi()`, not Swagger. FastAPI's
console moved to `/docs/api` (ReDoc is off), and `/openapi.json` is unchanged. The `/catalog`,
`/catalog/<slug>` and `/robots.txt` + `/sitemap.xml` surfaces live alongside it; see
[seo](seo.md), which also explains why HEAD is widened onto every GET route after registration and
why that widening must be kept out of the schema.

## OAuth + MCP routes

treg is an OAuth authorization server for its own MCP endpoint. Detail in
`architecture/mcp-oauth.md`; this is the surface.

    GET  /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource      what guards /mcp/ (served at BOTH v1 lookup paths)
    GET  /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/v2
                                                    distinct metadata for /mcp/v2/
    GET  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server    endpoints, S256, DCR + CIMD support
    POST /oauth/register                            dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
    GET  /oauth/authorize                           the consent screen (JSON with Accept: application/json)
    POST /oauth/authorize                           the human's decision — approval is never a GET
    POST /oauth/token                               authorization_code and refresh_token grants
    POST /oauth/revoke                              RFC 7009; ends the whole refresh family, always 200
    GET  /oauth/grants                              live (non-retired, non-expired) grant families
    POST /oauth/grants/{family}/team                move family authority to another member team
    POST /mcp/                                      the MCP transport itself
    POST /mcp/v2/                                   catalog-only Claude directory transport

    GET  /connect-demo                              a page that pretends to be an MCP client
    GET  /connect-demo/callback                     its OAuth callback
    GET  /connectors/claude                         setup, scope, pricing, data flow and removal docs

The V2 metadata and transport routes are available only when
`TREG_CLAUDE_CONNECTOR_ENABLED=true`. The metadata route returns 404 when V2 is disabled. New V2
OAuth grants and catalog-only calls are also refused.

`/call/` gained one thing for this: a metered response now carries `X-Treg-Cost-Micro`, so a caller
can report what it spent instead of diffing the balance. Absent on an unmetered call — a team's own
key is not ours to bill, and `0` would read as "free". On an **async submission** (a deferred
generation task) the header is the **reserve**, not the final charge: the task settles later at
the table row or the provider's reported usage, or refunds in full on failure; `GET /calls` and
`/calls/{ref}` carry the settled figure under `async_task`, and an idempotent replay repeats the
reserve. The CLI prints it as "generation reservation".

## `Idempotency-Key` on `/call/`

A caller-supplied label that makes a retry free. Sent on `/call/`, honoured only when present, so a
caller who omits it sees byte-identical behaviour to before the feature existed.

    Idempotency-Key: <caller's label>        → replay if we already answered this label
    X-Treg-Idempotent-Replay: true           → on the response, when it came from store
    X-Treg-Cost-Micro: <original charge>     → what the FIRST call cost, not a new charge

Refusals: `422` when a key is reused for a different request (a caller bug, and answering it would
hand them a response to a question they did not ask), `409` while the first call with that key is
still in flight.

Over MCP the same thing is the optional `idempotency_key` argument to the `call` tool, and a replayed
result carries `replayed: true`.

Reasoning, storage rules and the concurrency guard: `architecture/money.md`.

## Caller tags, budgets and per-tag usage

For a builder embedding treg in their own product and billing their own users. Design and rationale:
[money](../architecture/money.md).

**Tag a call.** Set the header from your backend — never from a model, which will eventually omit it:

```
X-Treg-Meta: customer=cust_8123, workspace=ws_9, feature=email-finder
```

Up to 5 pairs; keys `[a-z0-9_]{1,32}`, values ≤128 chars, whole header ≤512 bytes. Any violation is a
**422 before anything is relayed** (so a malformed bag costs nothing and does not burn an
`Idempotency-Key`). Values containing `@` are refused: tags land in an append-only ledger.

Every relayed response on either call surface carries **`X-Treg-Call-Id`**, and so does every refusal
treg raises before the relay, plus the saturation 503 (`_stamp_call_exit` mints it for the exits that never reach
`call_tool`'s own bookkeeping). The same id is written to the audit row, making it the join key for
your own records. An unexpected fault raised by `execute_call` is answered by Starlette as a bare 500.
The response has no id because Starlette owns it, but treg records the row and one matching
`tool_called` event before re-raising. Failures before `execute_call`, plus body-stream failures after
the handler returns its `StreamingResponse`, are not covered by that compensation path.

Metered responses also carry `X-Treg-Cost-Micro`; a reserved call that fails before a provider answer
carries an explicit `0`. That `0` is what the call ends up costing, but the **balance can lag it**:
if returning the hold itself fails, the money comes back when the hold is reaped rather than at once
(see [money](../architecture/money.md)).

| Route | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /calls?days=&before_id=&limit=` | this team's calls, windowed and pageable. Analytics — **not** an invoice source |
| `GET /calls/{call_ref}` | one call by its `X-Treg-Call-Id`, plus the ledger entries for it and its `async_task` view when it was a metered generation |
| `GET /calls/{id}/result` | what one call asked and what came back — the archive's copy; metered platform 2xx only, `stored: false` + `note` otherwise |
| `GET /calls/{call_ref}` | one call by its `X-Treg-Call-Id`, plus the ledger entries for it |
| `GET /orgs/{id}/usage/by-tag?key=&days=` | per-value spend for one tag key. **Money from the ledger**; admin+ |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /orgs/{id}/budgets[/{dim}/{val}]` | per-tag limits and blocking; admin+ |
| `GET/PATCH /orgs/{id}/settings` | the team's daily spend cap, budget dimensions and primary dimension |

`PUT /orgs/{id}/budgets/{dim}/{val}` is an upsert that leaves unsent fields alone — a PUT that only
sets `status` does not wipe the caps. Body: `daily_cap_micro`, `monthly_cap_micro`, `calls_per_day`,
`status` (`active`|`blocked`), `note`.

**Refusals a builder may show their own user.** These deliberately carry nothing about your team — no
balance, slug, platform cap or top-up link:

- `403 {error: "tag_blocked", dim, val, message}`
- `429 {error: "tag_spend_cap_reached", dim, val, spent_micro, cap_micro, period, estimated_cost_micro, message}`
- `429 {error: "tag_call_cap_reached", dim, val, used_today, calls_per_day, message}`

Caps are **advisory**: concurrent calls can overshoot slightly. Your balance is the hard limit.

**`usage/by-tag` reconciles.** `attributed_micro + unattributed_micro == total_micro`, for every key.
Untagged traffic shows up as `unattributed_micro` rather than being dropped.

**Isolation.** `treg org agent-new <name> --pin customer=cust_A` mints a token pinned to one tag value;
the pin beats the header and a mismatch is a 403. Rule of thumb: **tag for counting, token for control.**

## Referrals

`GET /referrals` · `POST /referrals/code` · `GET /admin/referrals`. Policy lives in
[money](../architecture/money.md); three API-shaped decisions live here.

**`require_identity`, not `require_member`.** A referral belongs to a PERSON, not to one of their
teams (`User.referral_code`). The reward does land in an org, but *which* org is our decision —
the oldest one they own — so nothing on these routes is scoped by `X-Treg-Org`.

**`GET /referrals` returns the referred person's full email**, which makes it the one route here
where a scoping mistake leaks another user's data rather than merely miscounting. It is scoped in
the query itself (`referrer_user_id == caller.id`), never filtered afterwards, and pinned by a test.
`privacy.html` discloses the visibility.

**`/?ref=CODE` is the one query string the landing route serves.** `GET /` deliberately treats any
query string as the SPA's and falls through to the dashboard — which for a referral link would send
a stranger who has never heard of treg to an empty app shell instead of the pitch. So a *lone* `ref`
counts as parameterless (anything alongside it still belongs to the SPA), and the code is parked in
`treg_ref` — httponly, lax, 30 days, and revalidated on read exactly like `_take_oauth_return`,
because a cookie is attacker-supplied and this value reaches a query.

Redemption happens at **first team creation**, in both org-creating doors (`POST /orgs` and the
legacy `POST /users`), immediately after `_grant_signup_promo` and with the same swallow-and-log
posture: a referral is a marketing nicety and a signup is not. It must never be why someone cannot
make a team. A failed grant recovers by rolling the session back, which expires every object it
tracks - so both doors read their response fields *before* granting, and the redemption revives an
expired `user`/`org` with `db.refresh` before touching them. The recovery path costs the team its
credit, never the signup response or the referral attribution.
