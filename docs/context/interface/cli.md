# The `treg` CLI

## Instagram grants

`treg connections connect --provider instagram` starts direct Instagram Login, prints the consent
URL, and polls the normal status endpoint. Page-only tools use `--capability page-tools`. Before
that consent starts, `POST /oauth/start` returns the selected authorization method's registry
description and the CLI prints it. The CLI contains no provider-specific guidance. Call errors
return the exact command for the missing method.

For a catalog endpoint that supports both grants, `treg call <endpoint>
--authorization-method <method>` selects the grant, upstream host, route, and method-specific
required inputs. The CLI accepts any method name; the API validates it against endpoint metadata.
Omitting it uses the endpoint's first declared method.
For a dual-method endpoint, omitting it first uses the sole connected grant when there is one;
otherwise the ordered default is Instagram Login. Static catalog templates therefore omit the flag
for dual-method endpoints, while dashboard-generated commands include the user's resolved choice.

A thin client over the API in `src/treg/cli.py` — every command is one HTTP call, no logic of its own
(stdlib `argparse`, reuses `httpx`). Entry point `main()` → `build_parser()` → dispatch to a `cmd_*`.
Every command/subcommand carries a `description` + `help` on each argument + a copy-paste **Examples**
epilog (a `mk()` helper + `_ex()` + `RawDescriptionHelpFormatter`), so `treg <cmd> -h` is self-teaching.
`treg --version` / `treg version` print `cli_version()` (package metadata); `treg update` (`cmd_update`)
re-runs the server's `install.sh` to upgrade the CLI in place. A global **`--json`** flag (stripped in
`main` like `--org`) makes the human-table commands (`org ls`, `agents ls`, `catalog` in all its forms)
emit raw JSON instead — one stable contract for agents; commands that already print JSON are unaffected.
**`TREG_CONFIG`** points the CLI at an alternate config file (CI/agents/tests; default
`~/.treg/config.json`). `org use` validates the slug against `/orgs` before persisting (a typo'd slug
exits naming your real teams; offline degrades to set + warn), and the server's "choose an org" 400 is
followed by a stderr line naming the bad `--org`/active-org value.

Every command builds its client via `_client(cfg)`, which returns a `_RegistryClient` (an
`httpx.Client` subclass). It survives an upstream WAF: when a request's body is 403'd by an edge (a
403 whose response body is an HTML block page, never treg's own JSON 403s), it re-sends the request
once, base64-encoded with `X-Treg-Body-Encoding: base64`, which the server decodes (see
[api](api.md)). This is what lets `treg upload` push SQL-bearing recipes and `treg call` proxy
SQL/HTML bodies through Cloudflare/Render. Transparent — no effect on any request that isn't blocked.

`_active_org_id(cfg, c, strict=True)` resolves the active org's numeric id via `GET /orgs`, falling
back to `/auth/me` when that 403s — which is what a MACHINE identity gets, since the server refuses it
there on purpose. An invalid token now exits naming the real problem instead of the bare "no active
org" that 21 commands used to print. `strict=False` is for callers that only ENRICH output (the pin
marker on `catalog get`): the catalog is public, and `sys.exit` raises `SystemExit`, which
`except Exception` does NOT catch — so a try/except at the call site would not have saved that page.

## Config + client (identity-first)
`~/.treg/config.json` (`CONFIG_PATH`) is v2: `{base_url, token, email, active_org, identity, admin_token}`
— **one bearer token + an active org slug** (`_load_config` migrates a legacy multi-org or flat config on
read, and tolerates a corrupt file as empty so a half-written config can't brick every command).
`_save_config` writes atomically (temp + `os.replace`); `login` persists the token **before** the
best-effort `_pick_active_org` lookup, so a transient `/orgs` failure can't discard a freshly-minted
token. `_pick_active_org` prefers the server's `active` flag, then the org a team-pinned identity token
bakes into its claim (`_token_org_claim` decodes it locally, unverified — covers older servers that mark
nothing active for such a token), and only then the first membership — an arbitrary team for a
multi-team user, so it is the last resort, not the default. `call --query` is relayed as a list of pairs (duplicate keys survive) and rejects a value with no
`=`; `contract_to_skill_payload`/`load_contract` raise clear errors (naming the entry/file) for a
stale/malformed `treg.json` instead of a bare traceback. Every "read a file / parse inline JSON the
user pointed at" path (`oauth connect`, `tool add/update --binding|--health`, `skill push|scaffold|init`,
`secret add --dir`) exits cleanly instead of tracebacking (`_load_json_arg` + guards); `_parse_bind`
rejects a non-int `secret=`; a one-shot `--org <slug>` override no longer wipes the stored active org on
`leave`/`delete` (`_clear_active_if_targeted`); `oauth connect` exits non-zero on a failed/timed-out
connect. `_client(cfg)` sends `X-Treg-Token: token` plus `X-Treg-Org: <active_org>` (the header is ignored
for a per-org token, and picks the org for an identity token). `_effective_org` applies the global
`--org` override; `_active_org_id` resolves the active org's numeric id via `GET /orgs` (for
`/orgs/{id}/...` endpoints). `_admin_client` uses `admin_token` else the bearer. `_show` pretty-prints +
exits non-zero on HTTP >= 400.

**Per-process identity:** `TREG_TOKEN` (+ optional `TREG_ORG`) in the environment beat
`~/.treg/config.json`, so each coding agent on one machine can run as its own scoped agent —
set them in the runtime's env (Claude Code settings env, Codex config, a project `.env`) and the
config file stays the human's. This is what makes the dashboard's "Scope this agent" promotion
real on a shared machine (the same per-process pattern other agent credential gateways use).
The override never touches the config file, so `treg login` can't accidentally persist it.

## The top-level IA (`treg --help`)
`build_parser()` returns a `_GroupedHelpParser` whose `format_help` renders the front page from the
`HELP_GROUPS` table (five groups, fixed order) instead of argparse's flat alphabetical wall — so the
listing is curated copy, not registration order. Anything **not** in `HELP_GROUPS` still parses; it is
simply absent from every listing, which is how the back-compat aliases survive. A subparser is hidden
by the `alias()` helper, which just omits `help=` (argparse only lists a subparser that has one);
`mk()` is the visible form. Subcommand `-h` is untouched — the top-level `add_subparsers` pins
`parser_class=argparse.ArgumentParser`, because argparse otherwise clones the *parent's* class into
every subparser and `treg call -h` would print the grouped front page instead of its own help.

```
THE CATALOG — tools you don't have a key for     catalog · call · balance · topup
YOUR OWN TOOLS — what your team already has      tool · skill · secret · connections
ON YOUR MACHINE — team credentials, locally      cli · with · serve
BULK UPLOAD                                      scan · upload
TEAM MANAGEMENT                                  audit · org · invites · accept · agents · admin
CONFIG                                           config · login · logout · onboard · update · version
```

The order **is** the pitch: what you can do with no setup comes before what you have to register
yourself, and `balance`/`topup` sit next to the thing that spends them rather than under team
management. `test_help_is_grouped_and_hides_aliases` pins both the order and that `catalog` precedes
`tool`, so a drift back to vault-first fails the suite.

**Old → new.** Every one of these still parses and routes exactly as before — hidden, not removed:

| old spelling | canonical now | note |
|---|---|---|
| `treg add …` | `treg tool add …` | one spelling for registering a tool; `cmd_add`'s name-or-id `--secret` sugar is unchanged |
| `treg oauth connect …` | `treg connections connect …` | same flags (`name`, `--provider`, `--capability`, `--client-secret`, `--scopes`) |
| `treg oauth providers` | `treg connections providers` | |
| `treg run …` | `treg cli run …` | |
| `treg runs` | `treg cli runs` (or `treg audit --runs`) | |
| `treg calls` | `treg audit --calls` | |
| `treg shell start\|stop` | `treg cli shell start\|stop` | |
| `sudo treg setup-local-run` | `sudo treg cli setup` | |
| `treg import` | `treg upload` | pre-existing alias |
| `treg health` | — | still works; dropped from the front page, `connections` carries the health story |

Bare **`treg connections`** now lists (the subparser is `required=False` with a parent
`set_defaults(fn=cmd_connections_ls)`); every other namespace still requires a subcommand.

## Commands
- **Team policy + scoping (all under `org`, all admin+):**
  - **`org agent-new <name>`** (`--role`, `--cap`, `--tools`, `--all-tools`, `--local-run`,
    `--projects a,b` / `--all-projects` — only sent when given, so a rotate never widens scope) mints or
    **rotates** an agent's token — a member identity for a machine caller (`POST /orgs/{id}/agents`).
    Re-running the same name rotates: the previous token dies there. **`org agents`** lists them with
    today's usage; **`org agent-rm <user_id>`** revokes. Nested under `org` on purpose — the top-level
    **`treg agents`** already means "which coding agents can I install skills for", an unrelated concept
    (`agents.py`). See [multi-tenancy](../architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
  - **`org pin <capability> --provider <p>`** / **`org pins`** / **`org unpin <capability>`** —
    the team's provider choice per job, enforced server-side (a gate, not a hint). `catalog get`
    shows the pin and lists only that provider's endpoints, so an agent does not learn the policy by
    being refused. See [catalog](../architecture/catalog.md).
  - **`org deny`** (`--host`, `--path`, `--method`, `--user`, `--project <slug|id>`, `--note`) blocks
    calls for the whole team, one member/agent, and/or one project's tools;
    **`org deny-ls`** / **`org deny-rm <id>`**. An empty field means *any*, so
    `--method DELETE` alone blocks every delete. Enforced on the proxy AND both run tiers — see
    [proxy-model](../architecture/proxy-model.md).
  - **`org project-new <name>`** / **`org projects`** / **`org project-rm <id>`** manage the optional
    sub-scope inside a team. `org access` and `org invite` additionally take **`--projects a,b`** /
    **`--all-projects`**, which ride alongside the existing `--tools` flags (the two ACL axes compose as
    AND). Deleting a project frees its tools back to team-wide rather than hiding them.
- **`config`** (`--base-url`; shows email + active org + logged-in) · **`login`** — three doors in one
  `cmd_login`: default browser handshake — `POST /auth/cli/start` mints the `login_id` **and a short
  pairing code**, opens the universal `/login?cli=<id>#code=<code>` page — the code rides in the URL
  **fragment** (a fragment is never sent to the server, so it stays out of request logs) and the `/login`
  page **displays** it so the user just confirms it matches the terminal instead of typing it (the
  anti-phishing guard: a login you didn't start can't be approved into a token, and the server still
  validates the code at approve time — the guard itself is unchanged). The page reuses an
  existing dashboard session via a **team picker**, else offers GitHub / Google / email-code, then polls
  `/auth/cli/poll` **with no
  code**; the poll result may carry `active_org` = the team picked in the browser, which `cmd_login` adopts
  directly, falling back to `_pick_active_org` only against an older server (where `/start` 404s → a
  locally-minted `login_id`, no code)),
  `login --email you@x.com` (terminal-only email OTP: `POST /auth/email/start` →
  prompts for the 6-digit code → `/auth/email/verify`, storing the identity token), or `login --token <t>`
  for agents/CI — which now **verifies the token via `/auth/me` before saving** (a rejected token exits
  loudly instead of the old misleading "Token saved"; a valid token whose user has no team yet prints a
  "create a team first" hint rather than a silent `Active org: None`). First login by
  any door also registers you (the user only — no auto personal org) · **`logout`** (clears creds).
  After a first human login, `_maybe_offer_onboarding` prompts `[Y/n]` then shows the 3-path menu (TTY-only).
- **`onboard`** (`cmd_onboard`, `--path setup|access|demo`/`--source local|global|both`/`--name`/`--yes`/
  `--reset`; `--mode` hidden, back-compat `quick`→demo) — a TTY run opens with a one-second `_splash`
  decrypt animation (the wordmark reveals behind a ░▒▓ wavefront; any key skips; off-TTY/`NO_COLOR`/dumb
  terminals never see it), then `_pick_path` presents an **arrow-key menu** (`_menu` — ↑↓/jk move, ↵
  confirm, 1-9 jump-pick; falls back to questionary where raw-key mode is unavailable). The interactive
  default is **Set up**; the smart org-based default (team-with-tools → Access, empty admin team → Set up,
  else Demo) applies only non-interactively. **Set up** (`_run_setup`) asks "Import skill/secret from
  where?" — this project / global agent folders `~/.claude/skills` etc. / both / an **other project repo**
  typed inline (a `_menu` type-in row with fish-style folder autosuggestion; "this project" is hidden from
  a root-ish folder via `_is_rootish` so it can't sweep `$HOME`), unless `--source` pins it — then imports
  the chosen `.env` + skills and runs a batched `health --run`. **Access** (`_run_access`, list tools+skills
  → multi-select `skill install` → a no-key test call). **Demo** (`_run_demo`) is now purely
  **illustrative** — no team is created, nothing is uploaded — showing the loop across four beats (scan
  preview → roles → a real no-key call if the active team has a callable tool → the audit log). See
  [onboarding](onboarding.md).
- **`invites`** (`cmd_invites` → `GET /invites/mine`) lists invites addressed to your proven email;
  **`accept <org-slug>`** (`cmd_accept`) accepts one code-free (finds it in `/invites/mine`, `POST
  /invites/{id}/accept`, sets it active). The code path stays as `org join <code>`.
- **`org`** — `create "<name>"` (become owner), `ls` (marks the active one), `use <slug>` (switch active),
  `invite <email> [--role viewer|member|admin] [--expires-days N] [--tools a,b | --all-tools]
  [--local-run on|off]` (admin+; prints the one-time code; `_resolve_tool_access` offers an all-or-customise
  checklist prompt when neither flag is given on a TTY), `access <user_id> [--tools a,b | --all-tools]
  [--local-run on|off]` (`cmd_org_access`, admin+; sets which tools a member may use + the local-run toggle,
  keeping the unspecified field's current value → `PATCH /orgs/{id}/members/{user}/access`),
  `invites` (admin+; lists live pending, purges expired), `revoke <invite_id>` (admin+), `members` (admin+;
  each row now carries `tool_access` + `local_run_enabled`),
  `set-role <user_id> <role>` (owner-only), `join <code> --email you@…`, `leave`, `delete <slug>`
  (owner-only; must name the org — confirm-by-name). A global **`--org <slug>`** flag (stripped in
  `main` via `_pop_org_flag`, applied through `_ORG_OVERRIDE`/`_effective_org`) runs **any** command in
  that org instead of the active one. See [multi-tenancy](../architecture/multi-tenancy.md).
- **`secret add`** (`name`; `--value` | **`--env-var VAR [--env-file PATH]`** | `--file` | `--dir`; `--kind`) ·
  **`secret ls`** · **`secret rm`** · **`secret update ID`** (`--name`/`--value`/`--kind` → `PATCH /secrets/{id}`;
  only the given fields). `--dir` auto-discovers the file via `convert.find_secret_file`; a file-sourced value (`--dir`/`--file`,
  and the `treg.json` contract secret read in `contract_to_skill_payload`) is now `.strip()`ed, so a
  trailing newline can't become an illegal header/env value downstream. **`--env-var`** reads
  ONE named var from an `.env` (default `./.env`) via `providers.env_values` — the correct, value-internal way
  to register an **unmatched** key: it strips a balanced quote pair (so `KEY="v"` stores `v`, not `"v"` — the
  malformation agents hit hand-extracting with grep/cut) and the value never lands on the command line.
- **`add`** (hidden alias) — the old friendly shortcut for `tool add`: `treg add <name> --base-url URL
  [--secret <name|id>]` (`cmd_add`). `--secret` accepts a secret **name** (resolved to its id via
  `_resolve_secret_ref`) or an id; default injection is a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
  `--header`/`--format` override it; `--base` aliases `--base-url`. Kept for old scripts and cached
  agent instructions; `tool add` is what we teach.
- **`tool add`** (`name`; `--base-url`; single-binding `--secret`/`--injector`/`--auth-*`/`--secret-field`;
  friendly multi-binding `--bind 'secret=ID,injector=oauth,name=...,format=...'` parsed by `_parse_bind`;
  raw `--binding '<json>'`; `--health '<json>'`) · **`tool ls`** · **`tool rm`** · **`tool update ID`**
  (`--base-url`/`--bind`/`--binding`/`--health` → `PATCH /tools/{id}`).
- **`import [env|skills|clis]`** (`--dir`/`--env-file`/`--skills-dir`; `--select a,b` | `--all` |
  `--dry-run`; `--status`; `--replace`; `--no-oauth`; `--llm` …) — scan a directory/machine and register
  what it finds; bare = **all three** (env + skills + clis).
  **env:** detect provider keys → secrets + tools (bearer/api-key/query/basic auto, OAuth pairs a
  per-provider connect, `--llm` for unknowns). **skills:** each skill subdir → a tool (from `treg.json`
  or generated from its script/secret) or a recipe-only bundle. **clis:** scan the machine for INSTALLED
  catalog CLIs (`shutil.which`), classify each (`providers.classify_cli`), auto-register the ready ones on
  the right tier (server-injected key / local **secret-less**, stored as an explicit `inject: []` so the
  catalog's inject can't merge back at grant time), and print an actionable, **plain-text** gap report (no
  emoji/colour, one CLI per line) — every missing piece names the fix (`set STRIPE_API_KEY` / `run gcloud
  auth login`); fix + re-run (idempotent; `--status`/`--dry-run` report only). **`--add BIN`** registers an
  INSTALLED cli that's NOT in the
  catalog (prompts for its key env var + API base_url) and prints a catalog-entry snippet to share; an
  unknown bin isn't server-allow-listed, so it runs locally until an admin allow-lists it. Brains in
  `providers.py` + `skills.py`; see [env-import](env-import.md).
- **`call`** (`target`, optional `path`; `--method`, `--query K=V` repeatable, `--data`, `--file`,
  `--content-type`, `--header 'K: V'` repeatable) → three shapes: named `call <tool> <path>`, agent-native
  single URL `call https://host/full/path` (path omitted), or a **catalog endpoint id**
  `call tikhub.tiktok.video.comments` — all hit `/call/<rest>`. **`--header`** adds an
  extra request header the binding can't know (e.g. Google Ads' per-call `login-customer-id`); an
  **injected credential always wins**, so a `--header` can never overwrite the secret the proxy injects.
  The **endpoint-id shape** (dotted, slash-free; an org tool with the same name always wins) walks the
  marketplace credential ladder server-side (`_resolve_marketplace_call` in api.py): ① an org tool for
  the provider (via passthrough resolution, so ACLs apply unchanged), ② an org secret tagged with or
  NAMED for the provider, injected through a **virtual, never-persisted tool named after the endpoint**
  (audit records the endpoint id; `tool ls` stays clean), ③ an actionable 404 naming the
  `connections connect` / `secret add` fix — reached only after ④ **treg's own key**, which serves any
  `platform_eligible` endpoint (priced + provenanced + live-verified) of an allow-listed provider
  (`TREG_PLATFORM_PROVIDERS`, the kill switch) with **no credential at all**, metering it against the
  team's prepaid balance: reserve before the request, settle on a billable answer (a provider-reported
  cost wins over our estimate), release on a 5xx/network failure, per-org daily ceiling, and a 402
  carrying `balance_micro` / `estimated_cost_micro` / `topup_url` when the balance is short. Tier ④ is
  shadowed by ① and ② (an org that brought its own key is billed by the provider, not by us) and never
  resolves for a demo org. `treg catalog get` prints which tier would serve you. The server
  validates method + required params BEFORE money is spent, and fills `{placeholder}` path params from
  `--query` (consumed — dropped from the relayed query via `relay(drop_params=…)`). Members restricted
  via `--tools` get no marketplace calls; a bare provider name (`call tikhub /path`) still 404s but
  points at the endpoint-id form. See [cli-audit-2026-07-28](cli-audit-2026-07-28.md) (design section).
  `-p` is a short alias for `--query`. `catalog get` prints the whole contract an agent needs to
  build the cheapest valid request: the PARAMS table flattens nested objects to dotted names and
  its NOTE column carries the prose rule, the enum (`one of:`), the default, the numeric range and
  the example; a `cost.table` endpoint gets a PRICE TABLE section (`_print_price_table`: the rows,
  `× field (from times_min)` for linear rows, the fallback ceiling, and whether the row or the
  provider's usage settles); an async endpoint gets an ASYNC TASK section (`_print_async`: id
  field, poll command and interval, terminal values, result location or retrieval command,
  lifetime) and its RUN IT template ends in `--await --timeout 900`. `--await [--timeout 900]`
  reads `X-Treg-Async`; without the header it is a no-op. Descriptor semantics come from `treg.domain.asynctasks` (stdlib-only, see
  the import-boundaries fragment), not a CLI-side copy. With the header it prints the task id and a resumable `treg call` command to
  stderr, polls static catalog ids or allow-listed dynamic URLs through `/call/`, retries network/5xx
  failures with backoff up to five consecutive failures, and keeps waiting on unknown status values
  after one warning. Stdout contains only the terminal polling response bytes. Exit codes are 0 for
  success, 2 for a provider terminal failure, 3 for timeout/interruption/recoverable polling failure,
  and 1 for malformed usage or metadata. Fetch-mode results print a retrieval command rather than
  downloading binary content; result URLs, reservations, progress, and TTL reminders stay on stderr.
  Running that command preserves a non-text response byte-for-byte on stdout (for example,
  `treg call openrouter.video-gen.result.retrieve -p video_id=... > result.mp4`); the upstream
  `Content-Type` remains authoritative, so the async descriptor does not duplicate a result format.
- **`audit`** (`cmd_audit`, `--limit`, `--calls` | `--runs`) — the single "who did what" view. `--calls`
  and `--runs` delegate to `cmd_calls` / `cmd_runs` verbatim (the old `treg calls` / `treg runs` output,
  byte for byte). The **default merged view** is the only new behaviour in the consolidation: it fetches
  both `GET /calls` and `GET /runs` (no new endpoint), normalises each row to
  `{kind, id, user_email, tool, detail, result, where, created_at}` (plus `task` - `status`,
  `settled_micro`, `result_url`, `fetch_command`, `ttl_note` - when `/calls` reports an `async_task`
  for the row, i.e. a metered generation), sorts by `created_at` descending and truncates to `--limit`. It **drops the `kind == "local_run"` CallRecords**, because `/runs` already
  surfaces those same grants as its `where: "local"` rows — otherwise every local run would be listed
  twice. Call ids are prefixed `c…`; run ids keep `/runs`' own `s…`/`l…` prefixes, so nothing collides.
- **`cli run`** (`treg cli run <tool> [--local|--server] [--] <cli args…>`, `cmd_run`) — a **dispatcher** that picks
  a tier by flag: `_run_local` (default) or `_run_server`. `args` is an `argparse.REMAINDER`, which silently
  swallows a treg flag typed AFTER the tool name; `cmd_run` guards against that by reading the **real**
  `sys.argv` and refusing a tier flag (`--server`/`--local`/`--timeout`) placed after the tool but before the
  `--` separator — while still letting a flag after `--` reach the vendor CLI (so `treg run db -- --timeout
  30` works and passes `--timeout` to the CLI). Two execution tiers (see [CLI-RUN-PLAN](../../CLI-RUN-PLAN.md)):
  - **`--local`** (default, `_run_local`) — run the vendor CLI on THIS machine as a dedicated `treg-run`
    user so the credential is unreadable by the member (see [local-run](../architecture/local-run.md)). On
    Linux with local-run set up, the member hands off via `sudo -u treg-run <runner>`, passing its own
    token through the environment; the **runner** (`cmd_run_helper`, the hidden `__run-helper`, running as
    treg-run) fetches the grant (`POST /tools/{name}/grant`), runs the CLI with the credential, tees stderr
    to match the profile's `errors` → a translated message + `run-report` (verdict enum only), and passes
    the exit code through. Shared core `_run_helper` — which, on a **shared-key** run (grant sets
    `redact_output`), scrubs the injected value out of the CLI's stdout/stderr via `_StreamRedactor`
    (boundary-safe streaming). Without setup it runs as the member, **best-effort**, with a warning.
    **`cli setup`** (`cmd_setup_local_run`, run once with sudo — now **Linux AND macOS**; macOS creates
    the treg-run user via `dscl`/`_create_run_user`) creates the treg-run user, installs the runner
    (root-owned, can only invoke `__run-helper`), writes a narrow sudoers rule, and installs the **egress
    allow-list** (`_install_egress` → [local-run](../architecture/local-run.md); `--no-egress` skips it,
    `--refresh-egress` re-resolves drifting IPs, `--registry` sets the host to allow). Its **`--run-proof`**
    flag installs the runner proof at `/etc/treg-run/proof` (root-owned, mode 0400, readable only by
    treg-run); the runner script exports it as `TREG_RUN_PROOF` and `_run_helper` sends it as
    `X-Treg-Run-Proof` on the grant call — which is how the server releases a SHARED (non-owned) key to the
    isolated runner but refuses a direct member call (without `--run-proof`, only owned-key tools run
    locally). `treg tool update <id> --local-run on|off` flips `cli.enabled`. **`--fs-jail`** (opt-in, macOS)
    confines the CLI's file writes to a private scratch (`fsjail.macos_profile` + `sandbox-exec`, forwarded
    via `TREG_RUN_FSJAIL`) so it can't drop the key in a member-readable file — see [local-run](../architecture/local-run.md).
  - **`--server`** (Tier 0, `_run_server`) — run a runnable skill's CLI **on the registry server** (`POST
    /run`, `--timeout` cap 600), secrets injected server-side, stdout/stderr + exit code streamed back.
    **`cli runs`** (`cmd_runs`, `--limit`) shows the run audit log — now **BOTH tiers**: `GET /runs` merges
    server runs and local grants, each tagged `where` (`server`|`local`; a local success has a null exit
    code, since only failures report back).
  `treg audit --calls` shows the local `GRANT`/`DENY`/`REPORT` audit rows.
- **`cli shell`** (`cmd_shell_start`/`cmd_shell_stop`) — **`cli shell start`** opens a subshell where the team's
  registered CLIs run with the credential injected transparently (a shim dir first on `PATH` routes each to
  `treg run`); **`cli shell stop`** (or `exit`) leaves. `--server-for a,b` routes named tools to the server
  (key never on the machine, if `server_runnable`), `--ttl MIN` auto-closes. **`--proxy`** (opt-in, with
  `--proxy-port` / `--renew-ca`) additionally catches HTTPS calls the AGENT makes on its own to a
  registered host — `_start_local_proxy` seeds the allow-list from the tool listing already fetched for
  the shims and hands `start_session` the environment + a stop callback. See [shell](shell.md) and
  [local-proxy](../architecture/local-proxy.md).
- **`treg <command>`** (`cmd_with`, reachable as `treg with` or bare) — run ONE command with the team's
  credentials: `treg claude`, `treg node app.js`, `treg with -- npm test`. treg is the parent, so only
  that process and its children are affected and nothing is written to any config file. `main()` routes
  a bare word here via `_looks_like_a_program()` — the word must not be a treg subcommand AND must exist
  on `PATH`, so `treg toool ls` stays an argparse error and a stray `call` binary cannot shadow
  `treg call`. See [local-proxy](../architecture/local-proxy.md).
- **`serve`** (`cmd_serve_start`/`_stop`/`_status`/`_env`) — the same local proxy as a **background
  service**, for a member who wants their own shell rather than a subshell. `start` detaches a child
  running `serve start --foreground` (via `sys.executable -c`, never the `treg` on `PATH`, which may be
  an older build); `eval "$(treg serve env)"` points a terminal at it and `--unset` reverses it (and
  works after `stop`, which is exactly when it is needed); `status` reads `~/.treg/proxy/proxy.json` and
  says whether THIS terminal is using the proxy. `_start_proxy_handle` is the one code path all three
  front doors share.
- **`admin`** (super-admin, cross-tenant): `login --token`, `stats`, `orgs`, `org <id>`, `users`,
  `tools`, `calls`, `health`, `grant`/`revoke <user_id>`, `suspend-user`/`rm-user <user_id>`,
  `suspend-org`/`rm-org <org_id>`. Reconciliation (price drift, provider spend, repeat-query
  rate) is deliberately NOT a CLI command — query `GET /admin/reconcile/*` directly or run
  `scripts/provider_balances.py`; see `src/treg/reconcile.py`.
  `_admin_client` sends the saved `admin_token` (`treg admin login`)
  or falls back to the active org token (works for an `is_superadmin` user). See
  [super-admin](../architecture/super-admin.md).
- **`skill`** (`init --dir`, `add --dir`, `scaffold <dir> [--out]`, `push <file>`, `ls`, `rm`) — see below.
- **`health`** (`--run`) — still parses; off the front page since the consolidation.
- **`connections`** (`cmd_connections_ls`/`_resources`/`_use`/`_rm`, plus `cmd_oauth_connect` +
  `cmd_oauth_providers`, which kept their names when the namespace moved) — your
  connected accounts, and where you connect a new one. Bare **`treg connections`** (or **`ls`**) →
  `GET /connections` (health + expiry). **`connect`** (`cmd_oauth_connect`, ex-`oauth connect`) has two
  modes: **registry** — `--provider <service>` (e.g. `google-search-console`), optional `--capability` to
  pick a scope set (default read) and optional `name`, so treg's app supplies the client credentials; or
  **bring-your-own** — `name --client-secret <file> --scopes …` reads your own Google OAuth client JSON
  (`_byo_body`). Either posts `/oauth/start`, prints the consent URL, and polls `/oauth/status` ~5 min.
  **`providers`** (`cmd_oauth_providers` → `GET /oauth/providers`, ex-`oauth providers`) lists the services
  treg holds its **own** approved OAuth app for. **`resources <id>`** (`GET /connections/{id}/resources` —
  the sites/properties/accounts it can act on), **`use <id> <resource_ref>`**
  (`POST /connections/{id}/resource` — select which one), **`rm <id>`** (`DELETE /connections/{id}` —
  disconnect). The old **`oauth`** namespace stays as a hidden alias of `connect` + `providers`.
- **`catalog [platform]`** (`cmd_catalog`) — the **endpoint** catalog: what you can CALL, as opposed to
  `connections providers`, which is what you can CONNECT. No arg → `GET /catalog/platforms`, one aligned row
  per platform (endpoints / verified / capabilities / the providers serving it), busiest first. With a
  slug → `GET /catalog/platforms/{slug}`, grouped **by capability** so the same job across providers sits
  under one heading (`provider  METHOD  path  cost  verified-date|unverified  tier`), with any unmapped
  extended endpoints last. `_cost_label` renders the catalog's cost block as a scannable
  `$0.001/success`. Unauthenticated (`_client(cfg, auth=False)`) — the catalog is public, and it's the
  one thing worth reading *before* signing up. The CLI never parses the YAML itself (that needs pyyaml,
  a server extra); see [catalog](../architecture/catalog.md).
- **`catalog search <query…> [--limit]`** (`_catalog_search`) — find an endpoint by what it DOES when you
  don't know which shelf it sits on (`GET /catalog/search`). A compact ranked table: endpoint id,
  platform, provider, cost, `✓`/`·` verified, tier, clipped summary — footer hint `treg catalog get <id>`.
  Cost prints in **USD** (`_cost_usd`, 3 significant digits) rather than `_cost_label`'s source currency:
  the column is only worth reading if CNY and USD rows compare. The no-match message names
  `treg catalog request "<query>"` — the empty search is the moment the filer exists.
- **`catalog request <what's missing…>`** (`_catalog_request`) — file a "the catalog doesn't have X"
  report (`POST /tool-requests`, `source: cli`). Open endpoint, rate-limited server-side; a configured
  token rides along as attribution only, never a requirement.
- **`catalog get <endpoint-id>`** (`_catalog_get`) — the last stop before `treg call`
  (`GET /catalog/endpoints/{id}`): summary, provider + limits/pricing_url, cost in USD *and* the original
  currency with its note, verified date, the capability with a **siblings** table (same job, other
  providers — price and verification side by side), a `PARAMS` table by location with required first
  (`_print_params`), the paste-ready `RUN IT` command, and the example response pretty-printed, clipped at
  40 lines with a pointer to the full JSON. `search`/`get` are matched as positional **verbs** inside
  `cmd_catalog`, not argparse subcommands, so `treg catalog <platform>` keeps working and a multi-word
  query needs no quoting. An id that misses prints the server's `did_you_mean` ids and the exact
  command for the first one; the old "find one with: treg catalog search …" is the fallback for a
  miss that resembles nothing, since it sends the reader back to the step that produced the wrong id.
  The siblings table's `WORKS` cell shows a measured `0%` for an endpoint whose decided calls all
  failed; below the sample floor it stays the neutral `— (n)`, because the floor publishes volume and
  never outcome.
- **`mcp grants`** / **`mcp use-team <grant> <team>`** (`cmd_mcp_grants`, `cmd_mcp_use_team`) — which
  MCP connections this account has authorised, and which team's balance each one spends from; and
  moving one, without reconnecting the client. The grant id prints **whole** while every other column
  is clipped — it is the argument `use-team` takes, and clipping it made the one command this table
  exists to feed answer 404 for anything copied off the screen. The team was chosen once at a consent screen and then
  appeared nowhere: an agent reports a slug, `treg org ls` lists the teams of whoever is signed in
  *here*, and those can be two different accounts. See
  [mcp-oauth](../architecture/mcp-oauth.md#but-the-choice-must-stay-visible-and-reversible-afterwards).

`_parse_bind` defaults every field to a bearer `Authorization` header; only `secret=` is required, so a
multi-credential tool needs no JSON.

## Skill scaffolding + the `treg.json` contract (`convert.py`)
`scaffold_skill(dir)` walks a skill directory (`_SECRET_DIRS` = `.secret`/`.secrets`, `_RECIPE_FILES` =
SKILL.md/README.md) and emits a `/skills` manifest **stub**: the recipe + every credential file as a
secret (kind guessed by `_guess_kind` — JSON with `refresh_token` → `oauth`, other JSON → `secret_file`,
plain → `env`), and a tool with `base_url` and per-binding placement left as `FILL` for the agent to
complete. `find_secret_file(dir, kind)` (used by `secret add --dir`) matches by `_matches_kind` and
returns exactly one file or raises (none / ambiguous).

**The `treg.json` sidecar contract** (`CONTRACT_FILE`) lets a skill self-describe its registration so
treg is one command. `generate_contract(dir)` is the *semi-automation helper*: it auto-discovers secrets
(+ kinds), `_guess_base_url(dir)` scans SKILL.md + `*.py` for the upstream host (skipping doc hosts via
`_DOC_HOST_HINTS`), and emits **non-colliding** bindings via `auto_bindings` (shared with the dashboard's
`_classify`): the primary oauth/bearer token → `Authorization: Bearer`, each additional credential → its
own filename-derived header (`developer_token` → `developer-token`), and OAuth app config
(`client_secret.json`, `_is_app_config`) is skipped. `_oauth_secret_field` detects Google's `token` vs
`access_token`. base_url: a skill-name catalog match (`providers.match_skill`, e.g. google-ads/gsc) wins
over the `_guess_base_url` heuristic; whatever it still can't resolve confidently is listed in `_fill` for
the user. `treg skill init --dir` writes it; `treg skill add --dir` registers it
(`load_contract` + `contract_to_skill_payload` load the named secret files → `POST /skills`, so no secret
values live in the file; a `file:` path is resolved via `resolve_secret_path`, which swaps `.secret`↔`.secrets`
when the exact spelling is absent, so a shared contract survives the per-machine secret-dir spelling drift). `secret add --dir` **syncs back** into an existing `treg.json`
(`_sync_contract_secret`) so CLI-driven changes stay authoritative. **`treg skill install <name>`**
(or `--all`, `--dir`) does the reverse — pulls a bundle from the registry (`GET /bundles/{id}`) and
writes `<dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` PLUS its **companion files** (`_write_bundle_files` reconstructs the whole
folder from `bundle.files` — reference docs, scripts, nested subdirs; each path re-checked to stay inside
the skill dir, secrets never shipped), so a teammate installs a complete shared skill with one command;
a tool-backed skill notes its registered tools to call via `treg call`. A skill folder that **already
exists on disk is kept, not overwritten** (unless `--force`); the run ends with an **actionable summary
of the kept skills** + the `--force` hint, so a caller (agent or human) decides whether to overwrite —
the Access agent-instruction defers to this output rather than restating the rule. The push side (`build_payload` /
`contract_to_skill_payload`) collects those files via `skills.collect_files` (excludes `.secret*`,
`SKILL.md`, `treg.json`, VCS/build junk, binaries, oversized files).

## Caller tags and per-tag budgets

For a builder reselling treg to their own users (see [api](api.md) and
[money](../architecture/money.md)).

```bash
# a token pinned to one customer — the pin beats whatever X-Treg-Meta the holder sends
treg org agent-new cust-a-bot --pin customer=cust_A
```

`--pin` is repeatable and survives a rotate: re-minting the same name replaces the token and keeps the
pin, because a rotate must never silently unpin a scoped token.

Two commands for a team reselling treg:

```bash
treg org budgets                                   # every per-tag limit you've set
treg org budget-set customer cust_8123 --daily 5   # cap one of your users at $5/day
treg org budget-set workspace ws_9 --daily 50      # budgets STACK — both apply to a call
treg org budget-set customer cust_8123 --block     # cut one off; the caps survive
treg usage --by customer --days 30                 # what each one consumed, from the ledger
```

`budget-set` only writes the limits you name, so `--block` never wipes a cap someone set last week.
Caps are **advisory** — concurrent calls can overshoot slightly — and the prepaid balance is the hard
limit; don't resell them to your users as exact.

## `treg login` pins its token to your active team

The token `login` stores is an **identity** token — it names a person, not a team — but the CLI
re-mints it with the active org baked into the claim (`GET /auth/cli-token` with `X-Treg-Org`, the
same mechanism behind the dashboard's "your API key"). `treg org use` re-pins on every switch.

This matters because the token is the thing people copy *out* of the CLI: into curl, into an MCP
client's `Authorization`, into an agent's environment. Unpinned it fails there with
`choose an org (send X-Treg-Org)` — accurate, and useless, because the CLI had been supplying that
header invisibly all along.

Switching teams is unaffected: an explicit `X-Treg-Org` header always beats the claim.

`treg org overflow [on|off]` shows or sets the team's overflow-relay opt-out (`PATCH /orgs/{id}/settings`
`platform_overflow`); see `ops/capacity.md`.

`treg catalog get <routed id>` prints the ROUTING PLAN (order, accepted identity, price, HIT, expected
cost per hit) above the sibling table; the sibling table itself gained a HIT column (`stats.observed`
`hit_rate`). `treg catalog <platform>` rows lead with the endpoint id and show the unified USD price.
