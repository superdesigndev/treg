## Hero

### Waterfall Enrichment: Find and Verify Work Emails

```text
Using treg, build me a lead list: 50 US software companies with 51 to 200 staff
that raised a Series A. For each one find the VP or Head of Marketing, find their
work email, verify it, and pull the latest news so I have an opener.
```

**$3.62 for 50 companies** ([from a real run](/workflows/find-and-verify-a-lead-list)). Email finder from $0.0245/found, verification from $0.00625/call.

## The old way vs. the treg.to way

| | The old way | With treg |
|---|---|---|
| **What you pay for** | Apollo $59/seat + Hunter $34/mo + Lusha $49/mo, and a credit pool that expires monthly | One prepaid balance. A found email is $0.0245, and a miss costs nothing |
| **Keys** | One account, one login and one API key per provider, spread across machines and `.env` files | One treg token. Every tool in the catalog answers to it |
| **Picking a provider** | You use whichever tool the team bought last year | `catalog get` lists all eleven company-search providers with price, measured success rate and median speed |
| **Commitment** | Seat minimums and annual contracts before you know whether the data covers your market | No subscription. Test the coverage for cents, then decide |
| **The workflow** | Export from the prospecting tool, paste into the enrichment tool, upload to the verifier, reconcile three CSVs | One agent run: find, enrich, verify, deduplicate: in one pass |

## A real workflow

### Copy this into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex or opencode

```text
Find 50 recently funded AI companies with 20 to 200 employees. Identify their
head of growth or VP of marketing and verify their work email.
```

**[ Copy Prompt ]**

### What happens when you run it

**The agent finds the companies.** `catalog_search "search companies by size and funding"` returns
eleven providers for that one job: and this is the sharpest price spread in the whole catalog:

| Provider | Cost per company | Success rate | Median |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Akta** | free | 100% (248 calls) | 3.2 s |
| **Hunter Discover** | free | 100% (24 calls) | 1.7 s |
| **The Companies API** | $0.0019 | 100% (339 calls) | 0.3 s |
| **Lusha** | $0.004992 per 25 results | not yet measured |: |
| **LeadMagic** | $0.025 | 70% (10 calls) | 3.2 s |
| **Apollo** | $0.026 per page | not yet measured |: |
| **Diffbot** | $0.0299 | 100% (5 calls) | 0.7 s |
| **PDL** | $0.38 | not yet measured |: |
| **Crunchbase** | own key only |: |: |

Same job. **A 200× spread, and the cheapest option is free.** Coverage differs, which is exactly why the
price is not the only column: but nobody should pay $0.38 a record without knowing $0.0019 was on the
table.

**It finds the people.** Two routes, and the cheaper one is usually the right one. If you want everyone
at a company, `hunter.companies.emails` returns the known addresses at a domain in a single call,
**100% success across 597 calls, 0.4 s median**, the fastest endpoint in this whole workflow. If you want
one named person, `hunter.people.email.find` costs $0.0245 and **only charges when it finds someone**
(100% across 582 calls, 1.4 s). Enrichment fills thin profiles: Hunter $0.0245 (356 calls, 0.3 s),
Apollo $0.026 (263 calls, 0.3 s), LeadMagic $0.025, Coresignal $0.392.

**It verifies before you send: and this is the step that matters most.** Verification is the single
most-called enrichment endpoint on treg.to: **963 calls at 100% success**. It runs at $0.00625 with
LeadMagic or $0.01225 with Hunter. Finding an address is cheap; sending to a dead one costs you a domain
reputation, which is why the teams already doing this at volume verify more than they search.

## Proof from one real run

*Run on treg.to, 26 Aug 2026: the full 50-company workflow, one prompt, one key. Every figure is
from that run's receipt, published with its CSV at
[/workflows/find-and-verify-a-lead-list](/workflows/find-and-verify-a-lead-list).*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Companies matched | **746** on Apollo; the first page of 50 taken, one charge of $0.026 |
| Rows with a usable domain | **47 of 50** |
| A named marketing lead found | **40 of 47** (27 by Findymail, 13 by LeadMagic's role finder) |
| Work email found | **31 of 40** (22 by Tomba, 9 by Hunter on Tomba's misses) |
| Verified deliverable | **27 of 31**; 4 invalid; 0 unknown or catch-all |
| A news event for the opener | **29 of 31** (PredictLeads) |
| Wall clock, one call at a time | about 21 minutes |
| Total metered | **$3.62** for 50 companies, or **$0.13 per deliverable lead** |

**Where misses were free, and where they were not.** Hunter and LeadMagic charge only on success,
so their misses settled at $0.00. Findymail and Tomba list a free miss too, but neither reports the
charge in its response, so treg.to settled their calls at the list rate, misses included: $0.56 of
the $3.62. The receipt is the real total, not the rate card.

> **The honest read of this run:** 27 deliverable leads from 50 companies is one market on one day,
> not a benchmark. The hit rate on *your* market is what the $1.00 free credit is for: run ten rows
> first and read your own receipt before you commit to a list.

## Three things you can do the day you sign up

**Build a list for a campaign you have not committed to yet.**
Test whether your ICP even exists at the size you assumed. Company search starts free, so you can check
the market before anyone signs a contract for the data.

**Enrich the leads you already have, without a new seat.**
Point the agent at your existing CSV of names and domains. It fills in titles, company size and verified
emails, and marks the rows it could not resolve rather than guessing.

**Stop paying for bounces.**
Verify every address before it enters the sequence. At $0.00625 a check, verifying a 2,000-row list costs
about $12.50: and Hunter's finder does not charge you for the ones it cannot find.

---

## Who this is for

- **Founders** doing their own outbound, who need 50 good contacts this week and cannot justify a seat.
- **SDR teams** whose credits run out mid-month, and who want per-lookup pricing that matches actual usage.
- **Growth teams** testing a new segment where they do not yet know which provider has coverage.
- **Developers building sales agents** who want one HTTP surface across finders, verifiers and company
  data instead of four vendor SDKs.

---

## Before you sign up

**Why not just call the providers directly?**
Because this workflow is not one provider. Finding companies, identifying people and verifying email are
three different products, and the vendor that is best at one is rarely best at the others: the table
above is 200× wide for a single job. Holding accounts with all of them to find out is the expensive way
to learn it. If you already pay for one, connect it and those calls route through your key, unmetered.
treg.to is closer to OpenRouter for agent tools than to a data vendor: one base URL, one token, many
providers behind it.

**How are credentials handled?**: `S-OBJ-CREDENTIALS`

**Can I choose a specific provider?**: `S-OBJ-CHOOSE`
*(Vertical note: often the right call here. Coverage varies by region and company size far more than it
varies by price, so once you find the provider that covers your market, pin it.)*

**Can I use my existing provider key?**: `S-OBJ-OWN-KEY`
*(If your team already pays for Apollo or Hunter, this is the first thing to do. Those calls stop costing
you anything on treg.to.)*

**What happens if a provider fails?**: `S-OBJ-FAILURE`

**How much does a call cost?**
A found work email is $0.0245 with Hunter and a miss is free. Verification is $0.00625. Company search
ranges from free to $0.38 a record depending on provider. The exact price is shown before the call, and
treg.to adds no markup to what the provider charges. New teams start with $1.00 of free credit: enough
for roughly 40 verified email lookups before you spend anything.

**Which agents does it work with?**: `S-OBJ-AGENTS`

**How does this compare to Clay?**
Clay is a visual table for GTM workflows. treg.to is a catalog of the same data providers Clay calls,
exposed as tools your agent can use directly. If you already think in prompts rather than spreadsheet
formulas, you skip the table and get the same waterfall enrichment in one paste. The providers are the
same (Apollo, Hunter, Clearbit, etc.); the interface is your agent. Clay is not in the treg.to catalog
because it is a workflow tool, not a data API.

**Is there an Apollo MCP or Hunter MCP?**
Yes. The treg.to MCP server gives your agent access to Apollo, Hunter and the other enrichment providers
through one connection. Install once, and every provider in the catalog answers to it. See `/llms.txt`
for the setup line.

# Ad and creator kit

### Responsive search ad headlines
| Headline | Chars |
|---|---|
| `Verified Emails, Per Call` | 25 |
| `Find Buyers From One Key` | 24 |
| `No Seat. No Credit Pool.` | 24 |

### Search ad descriptions
| Description | Chars |
|---|---|
| `Find companies, identify buyers, verify emails. One key, pay per lookup. $1.00 free.` | 84 |
| `A found email is $0.0245. A miss costs nothing. No seat, no monthly credit pool.` | 80 |

### Creator video hooks
1. "Eleven providers sell company data. One charges 200 times what another charges for the same row."
2. "I built a verified 50-lead list in one prompt. Here's the actual bill."
3. "Stop paying for leads you never contact. Pay for the lookups that found someone."

### X post hook
`Same job: "find companies matching this profile": priced across 11 providers: free, $0.0019, $0.025, $0.38 a record. Your agent can see that table before it calls. Most sales tools can't.`

### High-intent keyword phrases
`work email finder api` · `company search api pay per record` · `email verification api pricing` ·
`lead enrichment api for developers` · `b2b prospecting api no subscription`

### Negative keywords
`free email finder` · `gmail` · `personal email lookup` · `jobs` · `resume` · `linkedin scraper free` ·
`email marketing software` · `newsletter` · `spam` · `phone number lookup`

### Demonstration a creator can reproduce
Run the workflow prompt on a real ICP, then open the Activity page and show the per-call costs next to the
list. The strongest beat is the miss: show a lookup that found nothing and cost $0.00.

### Measurable hypothesis
Highest commercial intent of the five, so this page should produce the **lowest cost per first successful
call** at day 14. If it does, it is the vertical to concentrate spend on. Watch the second-order signal
too: enrichment buyers are the most likely to connect their own existing key, which lowers revenue per
account while raising retention: worth knowing before scaling.
