## The old way vs. the treg.to way

| | The old way | With treg |
|---|---|---|
| **What you pay for** | X API at $200/mo, plus a social listening seat, to answer a question you have once a week | One prepaid balance. Most social calls are $0.001 |
| **Keys** | A developer account per platform: and TikTok's is invite-only, Instagram's needs app review, LinkedIn's is partner-only | One treg token. Every tool in the catalog answers to it |
| **Picking a provider** | Whichever platform approved you | `catalog get` lists every provider serving that platform with price, measured success rate and median speed |
| **Commitment** | Monthly platform fees and quota tiers before you know if the data answers your question | No subscription. Ask one question for a fraction of a cent |
| **The workflow** | Five browser tabs, manual scrolling, screenshots into a doc | One agent run across five platforms, deduplicated into one brief |

**The honest version of this pitch:** the reason this is hard is not price, it is access. Several of these
platforms do not sell a usable public API at any price to a small team. That is the wall treg.to gets you
over.

### What happens when you run it

**The agent pulls posts from each platform.** These are among the most-exercised tools in the catalog,
so the records behind them are long:

| Platform | Endpoint | Cost | Success rate | Median |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **X** | tikhub search timeline | $0.001 | **100% (3,311 calls)** | 2.6 s |
| **TikTok** | tikhub hashtag search | $0.001 | 100% (436 calls) | 1.3 s |
| | tikhub video search | $0.001 | 100% (389 calls) | 3.3 s |
| | tikhub profile | $0.001 | 100% (365 calls) | 0.4 s |
| **Reddit** | tikhub search | $0.001 | **100% (384 calls)** | 1.0 s |
| | ScrapeCreators | $0.00188 | 98% (283 calls) | 8.5 s |
| **Instagram** | ScrapeCreators Reels | $0.00188 | 100% (300 calls) | 3.9 s |

Note the Reddit row: the cheaper provider is also the faster one by eight seconds and has the better
record. That is not a coincidence you could have guessed: it is what the measurements say, and it is
visible before you call.

A 200-call sweep across four platforms is well under a dollar.

**It reads engagement, not just text.** Views, likes, comments and posting dates come back with each
post, so the agent can rank by velocity rather than by how loud a post sounds.

**It clusters and reports.** Repeated hooks, the questions that keep appearing in comments, and where
the conversation is thin enough to enter.

> **What treg.to does and does not do here.** It returns real posts with real engagement numbers. The
> ranking of "fastest-growing" is your agent's analysis of that data, not a metric a provider hands over.
> Coverage also differs per platform: check what an endpoint actually returns before you build a
> reporting workflow on it.

## Proof from one real run

*Run on treg.to, 17 Aug 2026, on the topic "AI agents". Every figure is from the Activity log of that run.*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Providers considered | 4 for Reddit search, 4 for TikTok search, 4 for YouTube search, 3 for X |
| Providers selected | `scrapecreators.reddit.search.posts` · `tikhub.tiktok.search.videos` · `tikhub.youtube.search.videos` · `tikhub.x.twitter-web-fetch-search-timeline` |
| Why | tikhub was the cheapest on both video platforms ($0.001 and $0.002 against $0.015 from SerpApi and $0.01476 from JustOneAPI) |
| Total cost of the run | **$0.00588**: four platforms, four calls |
| Subscription cost avoided | X API alone lists at **$200/mo**. TikTok's API is invite-only and YouTube's is quota-capped, so parts of this are not purchasable at any price by a small team |
| Time to completion | Under 10 seconds across all four |
| Data freshness | Provider responses stamped **2026-08-16 19:07:31** and **19:08:30**; results included a YouTube video published 11 hours earlier and one published the previous day |
| Platforms covered | **4 of 4**: Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, X |
| Posts retrieved | 29 Reddit posts · 10 TikTok videos · 19 YouTube videos + 25 Shorts · X search timeline |
| Cost per 100 items | roughly **$0.007** |

Everything came back with engagement attached: TikTok returned play, like, comment and share counts per
video (top result 9,704 plays / 863 likes); YouTube returned view counts and publish age (4.7M views on the
leading video, 2.3M on the leading Short); Reddit returned scores and comment counts.

> **The honest read of this run, and you should know it before you rely on this page.** The Reddit search
> for "ai agents" returned **poor relevance**: the top-scoring results included an unrelated r/lol post
> and a news item about the Corporate Transparency Act. Ranking is the provider's, and on this query it was
> bad. The fix is cheap and it is the workflow the catalog is built for: search a named subreddit instead
> of the whole site, or switch provider. The measurements point at the same answer: the tikhub route is
> half the price, eight seconds faster and carries a 100% record over 384 calls against this one's 98%
> over 283. We used the wrong one, and the catalog would have told us so before the call.

## Three things you can do the day you sign up

**Find the questions your audience keeps asking.**
Pull the comment threads under the top posts in your niche and let the agent cluster them. What comes back
is a content calendar written by the audience rather than guessed at in a meeting.

**Check whether a hook is already saturated.**
Before you film it, have the agent search the exact phrasing across platforms and report how many creators
used it in the last month and how those posts performed.

**Track a creator or a competitor without a listening seat.**
Run the same profile and hashtag pull weekly. The agent reports what changed. A week you skip costs
nothing, which is not true of a subscription.

---

## Who this is for

- **Social strategists** who need a defensible answer about what is working this week, not a dashboard
  average from last quarter.
- **Creator marketers** vetting who to work with, using real recent engagement instead of a media kit.
- **Content teams** planning against what an audience is actually asking, across more platforms than one
  person can read.
- **Developers building research agents** who want one HTTP surface across platforms whose official APIs
  are invite-only, app-review-gated or partner-only.

---

## Before you sign up

**Why not just call the providers directly?**
On this vertical, usually because you cannot. TikTok's API is invite-only, Instagram's needs app review,
LinkedIn's is partner-only, YouTube's is quota-capped, and X's is $200/mo. Getting approved on four
platforms to answer one research question is weeks of work, and some of those doors do not open for a
small team at all.

There is also a result here we did not expect. treg.to carries **both** X's official API and an
independent route, and has measured both: the official search endpoint returns a usable answer on
**62%** of calls, while the independent route has returned one on **100% of 3,311 calls**. Paying $200 a
month is not buying you the more reliable option. We would not have known that either without measuring
it, and it is the reason the catalog shows a record rather than a logo.

treg.to is closer to OpenRouter for agent tools than to a data vendor: one base URL, one token, many
providers behind it.

**How are credentials handled?**: `S-OBJ-CREDENTIALS`

**Can I choose a specific provider?**: `S-OBJ-CHOOSE`
*(Vertical note: providers differ more on field coverage than on price here: one returns comments,
another does not. Read the endpoint before you pin one.)*

**Can I use my existing provider key?**: `S-OBJ-OWN-KEY`

**What happens if a provider fails?**: `S-OBJ-FAILURE`
*(Social endpoints are the most likely place you will see this, because they sit on top of platforms that
change. The catalog's `last OK` column tells you which ones have answered recently.)*

**How much does a call cost?**
Most social endpoints are $0.001 a call. Reddit search runs $0.001 to $0.01476 depending on provider. The
exact price is shown before the call, and treg.to adds no markup. New teams start with $1.00 of free
credit: around a thousand posts' worth of calls.

**Which agents does it work with?**: `S-OBJ-AGENTS`

**Is there a Reddit MCP?**
Yes. The treg.to MCP server exposes Reddit search, subreddit posts, comments and trending topics
through providers like ScrapeCreators and Bright Data. One MCP connection gives your agent access
to Reddit data without a Reddit API approval.

**Is there an Instagram MCP or TikTok MCP?**
Yes. Instagram profiles, posts, hashtags and comments; TikTok profiles, videos, hashtags and trends.
All through the same treg.to MCP connection, no platform approval required.

**What about Twitter MCP?**
The catalog has both the official X API (requires your own $200/mo key) and independent providers
that answer the same queries at $0.001 per call. Connect via MCP and your agent sees both options.

**Can I scrape Reddit or other platforms?**
The catalog providers handle the scraping. Your agent calls a structured endpoint and gets structured
data back. You are not running a scraper; you are calling an API that has one.

**Is there a Grok MCP?**
Grok is an AI model, not a data source. If you are using Grok and want it to call social data tools,
paste the setup line from `/llms.txt` into Grok and it can use the treg.to catalog.

# Ad and creator kit

### Responsive search ad headlines
| Headline | Chars |
|---|---|
| `Social Data, One API Key` | 24 |
| `TikTok + Reddit + X Data` | 24 |
| `No Platform API Approval` | 24 |

### Search ad descriptions
| Description | Chars |
|---|---|
| `Posts, creators and comments across platforms. One key, calls from $0.001. $1.00 free.` | 86 |
| `No developer account, no app review, no invite. Your agent reads real posts today.` | 82 |

### Creator video hooks
1. "TikTok's API is invite-only. Here's how my agent read TikTok anyway, for a tenth of a cent."
2. "I asked my agent what the internet said about my niche this week. It read four platforms."
3. "X charges $200 a month for API access. My whole research run cost less than a dollar."

### X post hook
`Getting API access to TikTok, Instagram and LinkedIn as a small team ranges from "app review" to "no." Here's how I gave my agent read access to all of them this afternoon.`

### High-intent keyword phrases
`tiktok data api pay per call` · `reddit search api for agents` · `social listening api pricing` ·
`instagram data api without app review` · `x api alternative for developers`

### Negative keywords
`free followers` · `bot` · `auto liker` · `download video` · `scheduler` · `hashtag generator` ·
`buy views` · `login` · `deleted posts` · `private account`

### Demonstration a creator can reproduce
Ask the agent one question about the creator's own niche, live, and show the posts coming back with real
view counts. Then show `treg balance` and let the number speak: the gap between "$200/mo X API" and this
run is the whole video.

### Measurable hypothesis
Widest top-of-funnel and the weakest developer overlap of the five: predict a **high Copy Prompt rate and
a low Copy-Prompt-to-first-call rate**, because a social strategist is less likely to have an agent
installed than an SEO or a developer. If that gap shows up, the fix is a page-level change: a hosted
"run it without installing anything" path: not more budget.
