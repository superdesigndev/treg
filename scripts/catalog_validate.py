"""Validate the endpoint catalog (src/treg/catalog/*.yaml) — schema shape + referential integrity.

Run from the repo root: `uv run python scripts/catalog_validate.py [service ...]`
Exit 0 = valid. Every violation prints one line: `<file>: <problem>`.

Checks (the success criteria from docs/context/architecture/catalog.md):
  - provider file's `provider` matches its filename and exists in treg.oauth_providers.REGISTRY
  - endpoint ids unique across the WHOLE catalog; id convention `<provider>.<capability>`
  - `capability` exists in capabilities.yaml OR the file's own proposed_capabilities
  - `platform` equals the capability's first segment and exists in capabilities.yaml platforms
  - required fields present; enums valid (scope, method, cost.type/currency/unit/source/confidence)
  - a `cost` block is BILLABLE, not decorative: a null `value` and `confidence: unknown` appear
    together or not at all; a verified/documented price names its `source_url`; every priced entry
    carries `checked` (WARN past 90 days); free is spelled exactly one way
  - a `verified` endpoint must have an existing example_response file
  - an extended endpoint a verification run has touched claims exactly one non-empty state
    (verified | unverified | untestable | skipped), and an `untestable` one carries no
    test_request for a re-verify run to call it with anyway
  - no obvious credential leak (Authorization/token values) in any catalog file

Two tiers, two rule sets. `<provider>.yaml` holds hand-curated `tier: core` entries and every rule
above applies. `<provider>.extended.yaml` holds the machine-generated coverage tier written by
scripts/catalog_ingest.py: those entries need only id/platform/method/path/summary, and carry no
capability (nothing has been mapped to the taxonomy yet). Id-prefix, id-uniqueness, platform
integrity and the leak scan apply to BOTH — an extended entry that does declare a capability is
held to the core referential rules.

The evidence rule is deliberately tier-blind, and needed no loosening when the extended tier gained
generated `test_request`s and live verification (scripts/catalog_verify_extended.py): `verified`
means the same thing in both files, so in both it must be backed by an `example_response` file that
exists and a `test_request` to re-check it with. A tier decides how much is EXPECTED of an entry,
never what a claim on it is worth.
