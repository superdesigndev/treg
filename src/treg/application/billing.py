"""The ONE module that talks to Stripe — the mirror of `domain/money`, which is the one module that
moves money. Neither reaches into the other's job: Stripe authorizes a payment here, and the ledger
credits balance there, and the only thing that crosses between them is
`ledger.topup(org, amount_micro, payment_ref)`.

Two unit systems meet in this file and NOWHERE else:
  * our ledger speaks **integer micro-USD** (1e-6 USD) — a catalog call costs ~600 micro,
  * Stripe speaks **integer cents**,
so 1 cent == 10_000 micro and every crossing goes through `micro_to_cents` / `cents_to_micro`,
which refuse to lose a fraction rather than silently rounding someone's money away. Whole dollars
appear only in the settings and in what a human types.

**Credit happens on the WEBHOOK, not on the browser's return from Checkout.** The success redirect is
a URL the payer controls — treating it as proof of payment means anyone can type it and mint balance.
The one exception is the off-session auto-top-up charge, where the *server itself* holds the
PaymentIntent's confirmed status in its hand (nothing attacker-supplied is involved), so it credits
immediately and the webhook redelivery lands as a no-op. That safety comes from `ledger.topup` being
idempotent on the PaymentIntent id, which is also what makes Stripe's at-least-once webhook delivery
harmless: the same event twice credits once.

Async: the Stripe SDK is synchronous and this is an async FastAPI app, so every SDK call goes through
`_sdk()` onto a worker thread. A blocking network call on the event loop would stall every other
in-flight request, including the proxy's hot path.

Auto-top-up is the part that can go wrong expensively, so it is guarded in depth (see
`attempt_auto_topup`): recorded consent (the PSD2/SCA mandate — a compliance requirement, not a
checkbox), a monthly cap, a cooldown stamped in the DB *before* the charge so a second web worker
sees it, a consecutive-failure limit, and an idempotency key derived from the threshold crossing so a
burst of concurrent calls that all notice the low balance produces exactly ONE charge.

    Stripe-hosted (`mode=payment`) rather than an embedded form: it needs no Stripe.js, no card fields
    of ours, and no PCI surface — the payer leaves, pays on Stripe, and comes back.

    `setup_future_usage="off_session"` is what makes auto-top-up possible later: it saves the card
    WITH the mandate signals PSD2/SCA requires for an unattended charge. Asking for it at purchase
    time costs the payer nothing; retrofitting consent afterwards costs them a second card entry.

    `invoice_creation` is what makes the payment expensable. Stripe's card receipt proves a card was
    charged; an invoice is the document with an invoice number, a billing address and a tax ID on it,
    which is what a finance team actually accepts. It is post-purchase — the invoice appears once the
    payment succeeds, not when the session opens — so nothing here changes what the payer sees.

    `billing_address_collection` + `customer_update` are what put a real address on that invoice. The
    address is asked for on the Checkout page and written back to the Customer, so the NEXT top-up —
    and every portal-rendered invoice — already has it. Without `customer_update` Stripe collects the
    address for the payment and then throws it away, which is the failure mode that looks like it
    works.

    `allow_promotion_codes` shows the "Add promotion code" field. Note what a discount does downstream:
    the webhook credits `amount_total`, i.e. what Stripe actually collected, so 20% off means the payer
    pays $40 and is credited $40 of balance — a discount on the price, NOT a bonus on the balance. A
    "pay $40, get $50" promotion is a different mechanism (`ledger.grant`) and is not built.

    Currency is pinned to USD explicitly — the Stripe account's own default is AUD, and inheriting it
