"""Fold `callrecord` into per-endpoint, per-day reliability buckets (`EndpointDayStat`).

Why this exists: the catalog's "does it still work, how fast" numbers were computed on demand by
`domain.catalog.stats.observed`, a thirty-day aggregate over the audit table run by every web
process every time its five-minute cache expired (and again from cold after each deploy). On a
large audit table that query runs for tens of seconds, and its pages evict the ones the money path
needs. Here the same evidence is consumed once, incrementally, by the `treg-worker catalog stats`
cron, and the request path reads thirty small rows per endpoint.

How it walks the table: by primary key from a persisted cursor, never by `created_at` (the audit
table has no bare `created_at` index, and does not need one for this). Rows younger than `LAG`
are left for the next run: an audit insert commits a few seconds after its `created_at`, and the
ids are handed out at insert, so a row that is still uncommitted when a run passes its id is
always younger than the lag and everything from the first young row onward is deferred. Audit is
lossy by design (`audit.py` sheds rows under load), so the one remaining race, a row queued for
longer than the lag before its insert, only ever undercounts a day by a row it already might have
lost. The first run starts at the id of the first row inside the window, found by bisection on
the primary key so the backfill never scans a row older than the window. Until a run drains the
backlog, synchronous catalog observations are unavailable; the reader never substitutes an
unbounded live aggregate for an incomplete fold.

This module is the only writer of `endpointdaystat` and `endpointstatcursor`. It reads
`callrecord` and nothing else, commits once per batch, and holds no session across anything but
those two tables.
