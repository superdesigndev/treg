"""The landing page's live payments feed (the public Stripe demo).

A visitor curls the published demo token → treg relays a test charge to Stripe → Stripe fires
`charge.succeeded` at our webhook → the charge appears on the landing page over SSE, no refresh.

Deliberately tiny and in-memory: the feed is a marketing surface, not a system of record. A
dropped event on restart costs nothing (Stripe retries webhooks anyway), and multi-instance
deploys just mean each instance streams the events its own webhook delivery landed on.

Only server-chosen fields travel (amount/currency/created/id-suffix) — NEVER `description` or
any other visitor-controlled string, so the feed cannot be defaced (see landing-sandbox.md's
graffiti lesson).
