"""Audit writes — deferred and fire-and-forget (rule #2: never block the proxied response).

`record_call` schedules an insert on its own session and returns immediately; the response
streams without waiting. A strong reference to each task is held until it finishes (otherwise
the event loop may GC a bare create_task). Failures are swallowed: an audit hiccup must never
break a real call. `drain()` flushes pending writes on shutdown / in tests.

Back-pressure (why this matters): each write opens a DB connection, and the pool is small + SHARED
with the request path. Under a burst, uncapped background writes would grab every connection and
starve real calls. So: at most `_MAX_CONCURRENT_WRITES` writes hold a connection at once (a loop-bound
semaphore), and under an extreme burst we DROP audit rows past `_MAX_PENDING` rather than grow without
bound — audit is best-effort; never OOM or wedge the server for it.
