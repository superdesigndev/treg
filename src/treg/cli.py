"""treg — a thin CLI over the registry API. It owns NO logic of its own (charter: the API is the
only brain); every command is one HTTP call. Config lives in ~/.treg/config.json.

Auth is identity-first: `treg login` opens the browser, you authenticate with GitHub, and the CLI
stores a single **identity token** (first login also registers you). Then you work across all your
orgs — `treg org ls` / `treg org use <slug>` picks the active one, sent as `X-Treg-Org`. Agents/CI
can instead `treg login --token <token>` with a per-org token. `treg logout` clears it.

    treg config --base-url https://treg.to
    treg login                       # GitHub (register-or-login); or: treg login --token <token>
    treg org ls | org use <slug>
    treg secret add / tool add / call / calls / health / skill / admin
