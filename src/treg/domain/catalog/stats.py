"""What the calls we have already served say about each catalog endpoint.

The catalog's own numbers are *claims*: a price read off a rate card, a `verified:` stamp from the
day someone ran it. This module answers the other question — **does it still work, how fast, and
does it charge what it said?** — from `CallRecord`, which has recorded `endpoint_id`, `status_code`,
`duration_ms` and `cost_observed_micro` since the marketplace shipped. Nothing new is collected here;
it was always being written and never read.

This is the half of "compare providers" that only treg can do. Anyone can read a rate card; only the
party that sees every call, across every tenant, can say which of nine email-lookup providers
answered 400 times without failing. It is what makes an agent's choice factual instead of a guess —
see `docs/CAPABILITY-CHOICE-PLAN.md`.

**Aggregate only, and never below a floor.** Rows are pooled across every org, so the output must
carry nothing that could identify a caller: counts, rates and percentiles only — never who, never
when-exactly, never a params_hash. And an endpoint with fewer than `MIN_SAMPLES` calls reports
`samples` and nothing else: with two calls behind it, a "100% success" number is noise dressed as
evidence, and on a quiet endpoint it could also be one org's activity made visible.

This remains the authoritative read-only calculation. Catalog views reach it through the
`EndpointObservationReader` port; the hosted adapter keeps a bounded-staleness process cache so a
search burst cannot multiply this query by request concurrency. Percentiles are computed in Python
because `percentile_cont` is not portable to SQLite (the same tradeoff `reconcile.py` documents for
its JSON provenance).
