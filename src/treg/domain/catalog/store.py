"""Reader for the endpoint catalog (`src/treg/catalog/*.yaml`) — the operations layer.

The marketplace registry (`oauth_providers.py`) catalogs CREDENTIALS: how to connect a provider.
This reads the other half: what you can DO once connected — which endpoints exist per platform,
what they cost, and which ones were actually verified against the live API. See
`docs/context/architecture/catalog.md` for the data's schema and curation process.

SERVER-SIDE ONLY. The CLI must never import this (it pulls in pyyaml, which is a `[server]` extra);
`treg catalog` is a thin client over the /catalog/* endpoints like every other CLI command.

The data is read-only and changes only on deploy, so it is parsed once and cached in the process.
A missing or half-written catalog dir degrades to an empty catalog rather than failing startup —
serving no endpoints is a worse product, not a broken server.

#   utility — helpers with no data of their own (token generators, enum/location lookups, decrypt).
# `data`+`action` are the browse surface; `account`+`utility` are "management endpoints" — served in
# the endpoint list with `kind` set, but kept OUT of the census counts and the default platform view.

        `usd` is None when the value or the rate is unknown — never 0, because "we don't know" and
        "it's free" are different answers and only one of them may be billed against.

        Three kinds of denomination convert, and they convert differently:
          - a real currency (USD, CNY) via fx.yaml `rates_to_usd`, keyed by currency;
          - `currency: credit` — NOT a currency but a PROVIDER-scoped unit (one scrapecreators

        Hence `provider`. A null rate keeps `usd` None and the client displays the native amount.
