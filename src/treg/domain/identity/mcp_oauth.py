"""treg as an OAuth **authorization server** — the metadata, and the tokens it will issue.

Everywhere else treg speaks OAuth as a *client*: `oauth.py` builds PKCE challenges to sign in with
GitHub and to connect a provider account. This is the other direction — the thing that mints tokens
rather than the thing that redeems them.

This module is deliberately the FIRST piece built, and on its own it issues nothing. It is the part
that **refuses**: the metadata that tells a client what we support, and the validation that rejects a
token which is expired, forged, or minted for somebody else's server. Building the refusal before
the issuance means there is never a window where we accept tokens we have not yet learned to check.

**The `aud` claim is the load-bearing one.** The MCP spec has the client send `resource=<the mcp
url>` on both the authorize and the token request, and the authorization server must copy it into the
token's audience. Without checking it, a token a user granted to *some other* MCP server would work
on ours — the user consented to that server, not to treg, and we would be spending their treg balance
on the strength of it. `read_access_token` therefore takes the expected audience as a REQUIRED
argument. There is no default and no "skip the check" path, because the one thing that must never
happen by accident is not checking.

Not ChatGPT-specific. The MCP authorization spec is the same for every compliant client, so this
serves Claude Code, Cursor and anything else that implements it. See `docs/MCP-OAUTH-PLAN.md`.
