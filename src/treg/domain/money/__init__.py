"""The ONE code path that moves money. Nothing else may write creditblock/ledgerentry/hold or
`org.balance_micro` — every mutation goes through the five operations below.

Units: **integer micro-USD** (1e-6 USD) everywhere. Never floats, never cents. A catalog call costs
~600 micro ($0.0006), so cents cannot represent one call and floats cannot be summed for a year
without drifting. The only float in sight is the margin RATE, and it is turned into an integer
immediately (see `with_margin`).

Shape:
  grant   → new promotional block, balance up            (org creation)
  topup   → new purchased block, balance up              (phase 4: after Stripe has authorized)
  reserve → balance down by the estimate, Hold opened    (the hot-path spend gate)
  settle  → blocks down by the observed cost, Hold closed, balance refunded the difference
  release → Hold closed, balance refunded in full        (upstream failure — not billable)

Invariant: `org.balance_micro == sum(block.remaining_micro) - sum(open hold.amount_micro)`.
It is a materialized column, not a query, because `reserve` has to be a single conditional UPDATE
(see below) — and every operation writes its LedgerEntry in the SAME transaction as the movement,
synchronously, in-request. Never route a ledger write through `audit.py`: it drops rows past its
queue bound and swallows exceptions, which is right for analytics and fatal for money.

**Margin is applied INSIDE this module** (`with_margin`), at reserve AND at settle — callers pass raw
provider cost in micro-USD and never think about markup. Doing it here is what makes the rate
auditable: every reserve/settle entry records the `margin` that was in force, so a rate change can't
retroactively rewrite what a call cost. (The alternative — margin at the call site — would let two
call sites disagree.)

Concurrency: `reserve` is one statement —
    UPDATE org SET balance_micro = balance_micro - :est WHERE id = :org AND balance_micro >= :est
so the database, not our process, decides who gets the last cent. rowcount 0 means insufficient
funds. This is why there is no SELECT-then-UPDATE and no application lock, and it behaves the same
on SQLite and Postgres. N concurrent callers against a balance that affords K get exactly K
successes.

Hold reaper: LAZY, at the top of `reserve`, scoped to the org that is calling. A crash between
relay and settle would otherwise strand that money forever, and the alternative (a background timer)
would need a scheduler, a leader election on multi-instance deploys, and would still only run on a
timer. Sweeping one org's stale holds is a single indexed DELETE-ish pass on the rare occasion any
exist, paid by the caller who benefits from it — and any org that never calls again has no balance
to strand in the first place.
