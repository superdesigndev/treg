"""The referral program: who invited whom, whether we owe for it, and paying it out.

This module DECIDES; `domain/money` MOVES. The only money crossing is `ledger.grant(...)`, exactly
as `billing.py`'s only crossing is `ledger.topup(...)`. Nothing here writes `creditblock`,
`ledgerentry` or `org.balance_micro`, and nothing here goes through `audit.py` (which sheds rows
under load — right for analytics, fatal for money).

THE SHAPE, and why it is this shape
-----------------------------------
Both sides get $5, flat and symmetric. The qualifying event is the friend's FIRST
PAID TOP-UP, never their signup: `promo_grant_micro` is granted per ORG and a user may create
unlimited orgs, so a signup-triggered bounty is a faucet pointed at itself.

Payment is held for `referral_hold_days` and then granted lazily. There is no scheduler anywhere
in treg by design (see domain/money's reaper), so `sweep()` is called from paths someone is already
paying for: every top-up, and the Referrals page itself.

WHAT ARBITRATES A DOUBLE PAYOUT
-------------------------------
The `Referral` row, via two UNIQUE constraints — NOT `ledger.grant(once=True)`, whose check is a
SELECT with no backing index and which therefore cannot survive two concurrent redemptions. So
every grant here passes `once=False` and the database decides. Same reasoning as the conditional
UPDATE in `ledger.reserve` and the unique `stripe_payment_intent` in `ledger.topup`.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It never reverses a grant that has already landed. Referral credit burns before purchased credit
(`ledger._KIND_ORDER`), so by the time a dispute arrives the money is usually spent, and inventing
a negative-balance path would mean a second module that can move money. A dispute inside the hold
cancels the payout; a dispute after it is logged for a human. That boundary is the whole reason
the hold exists.

WHO OWNS THE TRANSACTIONS
-------------------------
This module is the checkpoint owner of a multi-transaction saga on a session the application
opened (the Stripe webhook's, or the Referrals page's); the money primitives it calls never
commit - every commit here is a named recovery point (claim, stamp, qualify), and the ORDER of
those durable checkpoints is the whole safety argument for paying at most once.

    """"You were invited — here is what a top-up earns you." None when there is nothing to say.

    The mirror of `summary`, for the OTHER party. A team that arrived through someone's link has a
    `pending` row and does not know it: the bounty is invisible until it either lands or doesn't, and
    a reward nobody was told about cannot change what they do. So the billing page — the one screen
    where they are already deciding how much to add — says the minimum out loud.

    Returns only while `pending`. Once qualified the referee's bonus is ALREADY IN THEIR BALANCE
    (see `qualify`), so the balance is the confirmation and a banner promising money that has
    already arrived is noise.

    Names the referrer, MASKED (`j•••@superdesign.dev`). Not anonymous, because "you were invited"
    with nobody attached reads as marketing copy rather than a fact, and someone who clicked a link
    off a tweet a week ago genuinely may not remember whose it was. Not the full address either: a
    referral link is PUBLIC by design, so printing it in full would publish one influencer's email to
    every stranger who signs up through their link — a harvestable list, at exactly the volume this
    program is meant to produce. The domain survives masking because that is the part that actually
    triggers recognition in a real friend.

    Note the asymmetry with `summary`, which returns FULL referee addresses: there, the referrer
    cannot otherwise tell which of their invitations converted. Here the referee needs no identity to
    decide whether to add funds, so the same exposure buys nothing.
