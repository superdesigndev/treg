"""Phase B — credential health: periodically prove every credential and alert its owner.

`run_all` is triggered on demand (POST /health/run) and by a Render Cron. For each tool it:
  1. refreshes any oauth secret (a failed refresh = invalid), then
  2. runs the tool's optional probe ({method, path, expect_status}) with the credential injected.
It records status (unknown | ok | invalid) on each secret, and webhooks the owners of invalid ones.
The runner reuses the SAME refresh path as the live call (oauth.ensure_fresh) — one source of truth.
