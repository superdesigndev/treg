"""Process cache and Postgres adapter for Catalog endpoint observations.

Catalog reliability is an optional, lossy read model. A cold cache must never make an open Catalog
request wait for Postgres, while a search burst must never turn one slow aggregate into one checked
out connection per request. This adapter therefore serves fresh or stale endpoint entries
immediately and owns one process-level refresh task for every concurrent caller.
