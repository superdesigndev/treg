"""The relay — a faithful, smart proxy. The whole product in one function.

Faithfulness contract — it alters ONLY these, everything else is relayed verbatim
(method, path, ALL query params incl. duplicates, caller headers, caller cookies, body bytes streamed):
  1. transport/hop-by-hop headers — re-derived for the new hop (forwarding stale ones corrupts
     the stream); httpx sets them correctly upstream.
  2. treg's own control/infra headers + the edge's forwarding headers (`x-treg-*`,
     `ngrok-skip-browser-warning`, `x-forwarded-*`, `x-real-ip`, `forwarded`, `via`) — stripped so
     they never leak upstream. treg's own cookies (`treg_session`, `treg_oauth_state`) are scrubbed
     from the Cookie header too (the dashboard's `credentials:'include'` Try-it would otherwise leak
     our session token to the upstream); any other caller cookies are preserved.
  3. the credential(s) the tool's bindings inject — overwrite only their target header/param.

It never buffers the body (rule 5: stream, don't duplicate) and uses the shared long-lived
httpx client (rule 1: keepalive). Secrets are passed already-loaded (api does the DB work).
