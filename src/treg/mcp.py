"""The MCP front door — treg's own operations, exposed to an agent that has no terminal.

A coding agent reaches treg through the CLI, and the skill tells it which commands to run. An agent
inside ChatGPT or a Codex plugin has no CLI, and telling it to install one is where the visitor
leaves. This module is the other door: six tools over MCP, so an agent can search the catalog, read
a price and make the call without anything being installed first.

**Six tools, not 2,600.** The catalog stays *data* — one tool searches it, one reads an entry, one
calls an endpoint. Exposing every endpoint as its own MCP tool would flood the model's context with
2,600 schemas and make the catalog unusable, which is the opposite of the point.

**One implementation of the rules.** Everything that touches money, tenancy or credentials goes back
through treg's own HTTP API in-process (`httpx.ASGITransport`), rather than reaching into the
internals a second time. `/call/` already enforces the per-member tool ACL, deny rules, the per-user
daily cap, the platform daily cap, the balance reserve and the settle — a second entrance that
re-implemented any of that is exactly how one copy quietly stops being enforced. The cost is one
in-process round trip with no socket, which measured at well under a millisecond.

The **catalog** is read directly from `catalog_store` rather than through the API, because it is
already parsed in memory and answering from it takes ~1 ms. That is a performance choice, not a
permission one: every tool requires a credential, and the transport refuses an uncredentialed call
before it reaches any of them.

**Headers are not identity.** The SDK's own docstring says it and it is worth repeating: the bearer
token arriving on an MCP request is client-supplied input. It is validated against the database on
every call by the same code the HTTP API uses — never trusted because it looks well-formed.

Transport is **stateless streamable HTTP with JSON responses**: production runs more than one
instance, and a session-bound transport would need sticky routing to be reliable.

Mounting has one trap, and it is silent: `app.mount()` does NOT run the mounted app's lifespan, and
the session manager initialises its task group there — every request then fails with "Task group is
not initialized". `bootstrap.py` composes this module's lifespan with its own; see `mcp_lifespan`.

# What each tool returns. These exist so a model knows the SHAPE of an answer before it gets one —
# ChatGPT's connector review asks for them, and a model that has to guess at field names guesses.
#
# EVERY FIELD IS OPTIONAL (`total=False`), and that is the load-bearing detail. A strict schema is
# validated on the way out, so the first `{"error": "not authenticated"}` would raise instead of
# returning — turning a refusal written to tell an agent exactly how to recover into an opaque tool
# failure. Optional fields document the success shape while letting the error shape through, which is
# the trade worth making: a schema is a hint to the model, not a gate on our own error handling.

# NULLABLE as well as optional — EVERY field, not just the ones that carry data nulls. `total=False`
# says a key may be ABSENT; it does not say the value may be null, and nulls arrive from two
# directions. First, real rows carry them — a registered tool with no description, an endpoint with
# no published price; typing these as plain `str` made `my_tools` return a schema error instead of
# the team's tools. Second — the one that reached two users before it reached us (#93) — the SDK
# serializes the returned dict through a pydantic model built from this TypedDict, and that dump
# fills every ABSENT key in as `null` in `structuredContent`. So a response that never mentions
# `next` still ships `"next": null` to the client, and a strict client validating against the
# advertised schema (`type: string`, no null) refuses the whole answer with -32602. `| None` turns
# the advertised type into `anyOf [string, null]`, which is the truth of what we send.

        **Eager, not lazy.** Every treg tool needs auth, so there is nothing to browse anonymously —
        and the MCP spec's canonical flow has the client's FIRST request (the `initialize` handshake)
        answered with 401 so it discovers the authorization server and runs OAuth before proceeding.
        A production MCP server (Stripe, Subframe, AuthKit) does exactly this; FastMCP even tracks a
        401-free `initialize` as a bug (#3020). Leaving `initialize`/`tools/list` open was why Claude
        Code showed "✔ Connected" and never prompted — a connected-but-unusable server. So we
        challenge every non-notification JSON-RPC request without a valid credential, whatever the
        method. (`.well-known/*` metadata is separate GET routes, untouched — that is discovery.)

        The "invalid" case is what makes refresh work end to end. An OAuth client whose access token
        expired presents it anyway; per RFC 6750 the resource answers 401 with
        `error="invalid_token"`, and THAT is the signal on which the client silently runs its refresh
        grant — rather than giving up with "requires re-authorization".

        Only tokens that CLAIM to be our OAuth access tokens are judged here
        (`looks_like_access_token`); a per-org or identity token is the API's to validate downstream,
        and those callers (Codex with an env var) are not OAuth clients and cannot refresh anyway.

    Production sits behind Render's managed edge — not an account of ours, and there is no
    dashboard to configure — and that edge Brotli-compresses responses on the way out. A compliant
    client decodes `br` fine, but at least one real MCP client stack (httpx + brotlicffi, issue #93)
    dies mid-decode on large compressed bodies, and the failure mode is the worst one available: the
    RPC hangs until the client's own timeout, minutes after the upstream answered in seconds.

    `no-transform` is the standard way for an origin to tell an intermediary "do not re-encode this"
    (RFC 9111 §5.2.2.6) — and Render's edge IGNORES it (issue #100: `content-encoding: br` arrived
    right next to this header in production). The header stays because it is correct and costs
    nothing, but the fix that actually works is compressing at the origin — see `build_mcp_app`:
    an edge does not re-encode a response that already carries `Content-Encoding`. `no-store` rides
    along because these responses are per-caller and priced — nothing on this path should ever be
    served from a cache.

    An ASGI wrapper rather than a header in api.py's middleware so that WHEREVER this app is mounted
    — production, or a test building its own transport — the header ships. Same lesson as the auth
    wrapper below: wrapping only one composition path is how the other one silently diverges.
