    - **dcr** — dynamic client registration (RFC 7591). The client POSTs its name and redirect URIs
      and we mint an opaque `client_id`. This is what Claude Code and most clients do.
    - **cimd** — a client-id metadata document. The `client_id` IS an https URL that we fetch to
      learn the name and redirect URIs. This is what ChatGPT prefers.

    Supporting only one would lock the other family out, and we would not have noticed: the client
    we happened to test with first is the one that does not need registration.

    `redirect_uris` is the security-critical column. An authorization code is delivered to a redirect
    URI, so a client that could name an arbitrary one at authorize time could have codes posted to an

    An agent retries far more than a person does. Most of those retries are already free: a 5xx, a

    — treg called the provider, the provider succeeded AND CHARGED US, and the response was lost on
    the way back. The agent retries, and without this we call the provider again and bill again.

    Remembering only that a key was "already billed" would not be enough: we would still make the
    second upstream call, so we would still pay the provider and would simply be absorbing the double
    cost instead of passing it on. The answer has to be replayed so the second request never leaves
    treg.

    **Scoped to the CALLER, never to the key alone.** Keys are chosen by clients, so the same string
    will be picked twice. Scoped by key alone that collision serves one team's response to another,
    which is the single failure here that leaks data instead of money.

    The caller is `membership_id`, because that is what every door already resolves to: a person's
    token, an agent token and an OAuth grant all become one `Membership` (see `Caller`). So one rule
    covers every case — the label belongs to whoever called — and it does not matter whether that is
    a human, an agent, or two agents inside one team.

    Per caller rather than per team on purpose. Two lazily-written agents in one team will both reach
    for `retry-1`; scoped per team they collide and the second gets a confusing refusal, scoped per
    caller they simply never meet. Nothing is given up: this is strictly narrower than per-team, so
    the cross-tenant leak stays closed. Stripe scopes per API key for the same reason.

    `request_fingerprint` catches a client reusing one key for a DIFFERENT request. That is a caller
    bug, and returning the old answer would hide it, so the mismatch is refused loudly instead.

    `status` is `pending` while the upstream call is in flight and `done` once stored. The pending row
    is written BEFORE the call, so two retries arriving together race on the unique constraint and the
    loser waits for the winner instead of making a second call. Same reasoning as the conditional
