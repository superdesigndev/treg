"""Three query-time reports that answer "is the money real?" — asked of the rows phase 3 started
writing, never of a scheduler. Nothing here mutates anything: `ledger.py` owns every write, and this
module is the read side that checks its work against the outside world.

The three questions, and why each one needs its own source of truth:

* **Price drift** (`price_drift`) — did the catalog's price stay true? Compares, per endpoint, the
  estimate we RESERVED against the cost the provider actually REPORTED, both recorded on the same
  `CallRecord` row. Estimates come from a hand-verified sweep; providers re-price whenever they like,
  so a silent 10% climb turns a positive margin negative with nothing on fire. This report is the
  only thing that notices.
* **Provider spend** (`provider_spend`) — reads the LEDGER, not the audit table, because it is the
  number a human holds next to an invoice or a balance delta. Audit rows are fire-and-forget and may
  be missing; ledger rows may not (see `models.LedgerEntry`).
* **Repeat rate** (`repeat_rate`) — measurement only, the groundwork the plan asks for BEFORE any
  cache exists: how much of the bill was the same query twice. Answering it is what makes a cache a
  decision instead of a guess.

Units are integer micro-USD (`*_micro`) with a display-only `*_usd` twin, same contract as
`ledger.py`: never compute against the USD field.

Two aggregations deliberately happen in Python rather than SQL: the ledger's provenance lives in a
JSON `meta` column (portable JSON extraction across SQLite and Postgres is not worth a report), and
these are admin-scale windows over a bounded number of metered calls — the same tradeoff
`admin_stats` already makes.

    its own is not a rate card.

    The action field applies the review rule mechanically so the reviewer applies judgement, not
