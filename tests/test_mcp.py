"""The MCP front door — that it answers, and that it enforces the same rules as every other door.

Two halves, and the second is the one that matters. A new entrance onto a paid catalog is only safe
if it cannot see another team's data, cannot spend past the caps, and cannot be talked into serving
an endpoint whose price nobody knows. `mcp.py` gets that by routing through treg's own API rather
than reaching into the internals — these tests are what proves the routing is real and not merely
intended.

The transport is exercised as a real MCP client would: JSON-RPC over the mounted ASGI app.
