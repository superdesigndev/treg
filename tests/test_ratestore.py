"""DB-backed ephemeral state + rate limiter (treg.ratestore) — backlog #3.

The point of moving OTP codes + the auth throttles into the DB is that they (a) survive a restart and
(b) are shared across instances. We prove (a)/(b) here by writing with one session and reading with a
SEPARATE session — if the state were still a per-process dict, the second session would see nothing.
