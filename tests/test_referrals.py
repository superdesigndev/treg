"""The referral program — a door that hands out money to strangers, so these tests are mostly about
the ways it can be made to hand out money it shouldn't.

Covered: the whole loop (link → cookie → signup → top-up → hold → both grants); that NOTHING is
granted before the hold elapses and exactly one grant lands after, however many times the sweep
runs; every abuse gate (self-referral, a signup with no top-up, a top-up below the minimum, a second
top-up, one card claiming twice, the lifetime cap) — and that a FREE-TIER referrer is still
paid, which is the gate we deliberately removed; the dispute
clawback and its deliberate limit; and that one user can never see another's referrals — the single
failure here that leaks data rather than money.

Stripe is faked exactly as in test_billing.py: `billing._sdk` is the one funnel, and webhook payloads
are signed with the real HMAC scheme so the signature path is exercised rather than stubbed.
