"""Every `/call/` refusal leaves a CallRecord stamped `refused_by` — the funnel's early friction.

Before this, a call treg refused BEFORE the relay fell into two buckets: money refusals were
audited (but indistinguishable from a provider's own 402), and everything earlier — bad token,
unknown tool, ACL, deny rule — left no row at all. The 2026-08-12 Hunter incident is the motivating
case: 309 pre-relay refusals read as "Hunter is failing" until the rows were re-derived from
`duration_ms IS NULL`. `refused_by` makes that distinction a column instead of a forensic exercise.
